abstract1: "When it becomes so quick and easy to freely 'share' another's understanding (via retweets/reposts), rather than researching and formulating one's own, social media platforms seem to facilitate the spread of fake news. A recent study used an online crowdsourcing fact-checking approach as one possible intervention to reduce misinformation. However, it remains largely unclear under what conditions crowdsourcing fact-checking efforts can actually deter the spread of misinformation. To address this issue,  we model such distributed fact-checking efforts as 'peer policing' that will reduce the perceived payoff to share or disseminate false information (fake news) and also reward the spread of trustworthy information (real news). We use the diffusion approximation method and agent-based simulations to quantify the degree of penalty vs reward needed to make sharing fake news unfavorable in social networks. In the limit of weak selection, we obtain closed-form analytical conditions, which can be expressed as an inequality of these payoff values, with coefficients summarizing the effect of fact-checkers' presence. In reality, fact-checking is subject to human errors. Some fake news occasionally goes unnoticed and endorsed, and some real news is temporally labelled to be fake by fact-checkers. We also quantify the precision threshold required for fact-checkers to ensure fair and transparent policing of wrongdoers while in favor of real news spreaders. Our work has practical guide for developing model-based mitigation strategies for controlling the spread of misinformation that interferes with the political discourse." 
abstract2: "A challenging problem in infectious disease modelling is assessing when a disease has been eliminated. Control campaigns have substantial economic consequences; as such there are high demands to reduce costs and reallocate resources. However, if campaigns are stopped prematurely it can result in disease resurgence and subsequently put control efforts back by decades. Early-warning signals offer a computationally inexpensive technique to monitor the progress towards elimination, using statistical indicators calculated on time series data. Early-warning signals are widely used in many fields to anticipate a critical threshold prior to reaching it. A system undergoes the phenomenon known as critical slowing down as it crosses through a threshold. Theory predicts that fluctuations away from the mean will recover more slowly as the system approaches a critical transition (Scheffer et al., 2009). This is key in infectious disease modelling to assess when the basic reproduction number is reduced below the threshold of one. Recent theoretical advances have shown indicators of critical transitions in epidemiology such as measuring the variance in synthetic disease data. Our work highlights several challenges when applying this theory in practice. One potential problem is known as 'detrending' the data, which can be difficult to achieve in a single time series (Dessavre & Southall et al., 2019). Accurately detrending the signal removes the mean to obtain the fluctuations, whilst preserving any statistical properties.  We present a novel approach using a metapopulation framework to successfully detrend data using the mean of different geographical subpopulations. A second limitation is that often only incidence-level data is available publicly. However, current theoretical analyses of statistical indicators concentrate on prevalence data, instead of new cases. We demonstrate that indicators calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data (Southall et al., 2020). Inconsistencies in time series traits between different diseases systems and a variety of disease data types could lead to misleading results when applied to collected data.  In this talk we present methods for dealing with the typical data collected and our results show promising methods for calculating early-warning signals of elimination on real-world noisy data."
abstract3: "For decades, mathematical models of disease transmission have provided researchers and public health officials with critical insights into the progression, control, and prevention of disease spread. Of these models, one of most fundamental is the SIR differential equation model. However, this ubiquitous model has one significant and rarely acknowledged shortcoming: it is unable to account for a diseaseâ€™s true infectious period distribution.  As the misspecification of such a biological characteristic is known to significantly affect model behavior, there is a need to develop new modeling approaches that capture such information. In this talk, we illustrate an innovative take on compartmental models, derived from their general formulation as systems of nonlinear Volterra integral equations, to capture a broader range of infectious period distributions, yet maintain the desirable formulation as systems of differential equations. Our results include a compartmental model that captures any Erlang distributed duration of infection with only 3 differential equations, instead of the typical inflated model sizes required by differential equation compartmental models, and a compartmental model that captures any mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of an infectious period distribution with 4 differential equations. The significance of our work is that it opens up a new class of easy-to-use compartmental models to predict disease outbreaks that does not require a complete overhaul of existing theory, and thus provides a starting point for multiple research avenues of investigation under the contexts of mathematics, public health, and evolutionary biology."
