abstract: "Jensen equations describe the dynamics of an exogenous surfactant moving on the top of an endogenous fluid layer in biological systems.  The fluid motion is caused by the decrease in surface tension at the free surface of the thin film at the region of contact with the surfactant.  The variations in space and time of the surfactant concentration and film height are analyzed under different geometries.  We focus our attention on two biological applications; first, on the respiratory system, where an exogenous surfactant is inserted on the lining of a respiratory airway wall. Second, on the ocular region, where a surfactant is instilled on the eye lining. We conclude that the presence of the surfactant increases the fluid flow of the lining and therefore, can be used as therapeutic agent to prevent potential film rupture."
