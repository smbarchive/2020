abstract: "Neutral delay differential equations (NDDEs) are useful in modelling real life phenomenon which includes time lag. In this paper, we use nature-inspired algorithms to solve inverse problems involving NDDEs. Specifically, we show how the nature-inspired optimization algorithms can be effective in estimating parameters of NDDEs. We compare the following recent algorithms: (1) particle swarm optimization, (2) genetic algorithm with multi-parent crossover, (3) whale optimization algorithm, (4) crow search algorithm, and (5) cuckoo algorithm."
