abstract: "This study is about a novel ordinary differential equation model aimed at describing in vivo biodistribution of tracer magnetic nanoparticles (MNP). The proposed pharmacokinetic model is built based on in vivo experimental data gathered from images of alternating current biosusceptometry. Three compartments are considered: the one in which MPN is found free the blood, another for a reversible bound state of MNP with the liver sinusoid, and a third compartment for the MNP permanently absorbed by the Kupffer cells. As a result, the proposed model allowed us to suitably describe the experimental pharmacokinetic profiles, providing a promising theoretical-quantitative basis for the results of the experiments [1]. Besides, it also suggests that the multichannel biosusceptrometry system is a valuable imaging device to assess in vivo and real-time pharmacokinetics. As the latter was the main purpose of the first publication in the subject [1], further developments are needed to improve the model's parameter estimation using a Bayesian framework. The author intends to implement this last idea soon.
