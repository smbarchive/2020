abstract: "This talk is concerned with chemical reaction networks endowed with poly-PL kinetics, that is, the positive linear combination of power law kinetic systems. We discovered that complex balanced equilibria exist for weakly reversible poly-PL kinetics with zero kinetic reactant deficiency. The result is then applied to evolutionary games with replicator dynamics such that the polynomial payoff functions lead to polynomial kinetic systems, a subset of poly-PL kinetic systems. In particular,

sufficient conditions to admit a zero kinetic reactant deficiency were derived for games with nonlinear payoff functions and poly-PL kinetics, allowing the application

of the main result."
