title: "Mathematical Analysis of Feedback Requirements for Planar Polarisation in the Fly Wing"
subgroup: "CDEV"
presenter: "Eman Alwani"
institution: "The University of Sheffield"
abstract: "During animal development, oriented cell behaviours are required to ensure appropriate growth and structure. Planar polarity, which describes polarisation within the plane of a cell sheet, is an important example of such behaviours. During this project, I built a mathematical model aiming to gain a qualitative understanding of the requirements for different feedback interactions to establish planar polarisation in the fly wing."
