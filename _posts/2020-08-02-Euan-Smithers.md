abstract: "Pavement cells in the plant leaf epidermis form interesting and intriguing interlocking puzzle like shapes with undulations of lobes and indents. However, no one has been able to fully explain how these shapes form. There are two possible pathways of pavement cell development, one involving a combination of plant Rho like GTPases signalling proteins and cytoskeleton components, specifically microtubules which could provide a feedback loop and the second being possible mechanical effects from the tissue.

As a result, we have developed three models, one to model microtubule behaviour, the second to model the protein signalling dynamics and the third to model the mechanics of the cells, using a stochastic network, reaction diffusion equations solved via the finite element method and a visco-elastic vertex element model. I shall also outline some of the experimental procedures we have carried out to test how pavement cells develop. We can demonstrate that the signalling pathways provide a feedback loop to sustain pavement cell shape, but donâ€™t initiate the shape, while the mechanical effects from the tissue can initiate pavement cell lobes."
