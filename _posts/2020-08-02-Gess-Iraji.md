title: "Modeling Clogging of Red Blood Cells in Microfluidic Devices with Simple Geometry"
subgroup: "MFBM"
presenter: "Gess Iraji"
institution: "Brandeis University"
abstract: "We develop a basic model to investigate clogging of red blood cells in diagnostic microfluidic devices that sort cells based on their deformability. We analyze the effects of specific clogging rate functions on the progression of clogging in a device with simple geometry. We confirm our results using stochastic simulations and numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations."
