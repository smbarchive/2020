abstract: "Researchers have noted that there are unexpectedly few SARS-CoV-2 coinfections with other circulating respiratory viruses. We use an in host mathematical model to examine interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses, finding that SARS-CoV-2 growth tends to be blocked by the presence of other viruses. We then formulate an epidemiological model to determine how this blocking effect might influence the impending second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections."
