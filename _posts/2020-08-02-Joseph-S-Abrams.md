abstract: "The rational design of cryopreservation protocols is an effective method for improving the outcome of sample survival. Cryopreservation of preantral ovarian follicles is an experimental therapy for fertility preservation and is of particular value in prepubescent cancer patients. Post-cryopreservation survival of this tissue is unsatisfactorily low for clinical use. Current tissue models of cryopreservation are largely focused on mass transport and the cytotoxicity of cryopreservatives, however, the potential mechanical damage to intracellular connections in response to mass transport is not considered. Intracellular connections between the granulosa cells and the oocyte in ovarian follicles, known as transzonal projections (TZPs), previously, have been shown to sever during cryopreservation. We hypothesized that the damage to TZPâ€™s is due to variation in mass transport responses between heterogeneous cell types. Here we present a cell-based model, informed by experimentation, to capture mass transport, toxicity, and intracellular connections during the equilibration phase of cryopreservation. Using this model we explore several methods for improving cryopreservation protocols with a focus on improving TZP survival and thus post-thaw functionality.
