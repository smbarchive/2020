abstract: "Nitrogen is cycled throughout ecosystems by a suite of
biogeochemical processes. The high complexity of the nitrogen
cycle resides in an intricate interplay between reversible
biochemical pathways alternatively and specifically activated
in response to diverse environmental cues. Despite aggressive
research, how the fundamental nitrogen biochemical processes
are assembled and maintained in fluctuating soil redox
conditions remains elusive. Here, we address this question
using a kinetic modelling approach coupled with dynamical
systems theory and microbial genomics. We show that
alternative biochemical pathways play a key role in keeping
nitrogen conversion and conservation properties invariant
in fluctuating environments. Our results indicate that the
biochemical network holds inherent adaptive capacity
to stabilize ammonium and nitrate availability, and that
the bistability in the formation of ammonium is linked
to the transient upregulation of the amo-hao mediated
nitrification pathway. The bistability is maintained by a
pair of complementary subsystems acting as either source or
sink type systems in response to soil redox fluctuations. It is
further shown how elevated anthropogenic pressure has the potential to break down the stability of the system, altering substantially ammonium and nitrate availability in the soil, with dramatic effects on biodiversity."
