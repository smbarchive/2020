title: "Model-aided Understanding of the Outbreak of COVID-19 in Bangladesh"
subgroup: "MEPI"
presenter: "Muhammad Humayun  Kabir"
institution: "Jahangirnagar University"
abstract: "In this talk, we focus on a seven compartmental model to understand the infectious dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic. We show the boundedness and non-negativity of solutions of the model. We analytically calculate the basic reproduction number of the model and perform the stability analysis at all equilibrium points to understand the epidemic and endemic cases based on the results of the basic reproduction number. Our results reveal that regional lockdown and social awareness (e.g., wearing a face mask, washing hands, social distancing) can reduce the pandemic of the current outbreak of novel coronavirus in a most densely populated country like Bangladesh."
