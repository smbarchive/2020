abstract: "In this work, we propose a nonlinear mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of the Ebola Virus Disease(EVD) and the Hepatitis G virus (GBV) co-infection. The basic reproductive number is found by the next-generation matrix method. Then the infectious free and endemic equilibrium of the system is computed. The local and global stability of the system is presented as well. For local asymptotical stability, linearization, and Routh-Hurwitz criterion and show that if R_0<1, then the system is locally asymptotically stable otherwise unstable. The global asymptotical stability is found out by the Lyapunov function method. Finally, we present a numerical simulation of the proposed model."
