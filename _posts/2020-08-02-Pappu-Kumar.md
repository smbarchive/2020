title: "Theoretical investigation of non-equilibrium bio-heat transfer during thermal therapy"

abstract: "This study theoretically investigates the non-equilibrium heat transfer within living biological tissues during different thermal therapy applications. Numerical solution of the present problem has been done by Chebyshev wavelet Galerkin method. The use of Chebyshev wavelet is found to be accurate, simple and fast. Larger differences in the temperature prediction at the treatment position have been observed using different equilibrium and non-equilibrium based bioheat models. It is observed that the porosity and the convective heat transfer are the factors that contribute most to the non-equilibrium heat transfer within living biological tissues. The whole analysis is presented in dimensionless form."
