abstract: "We study pattern formation, fluctuations, and scaling induced by a growth-promoting active walker on an otherwise static interface. Active particles on an interface define a simple model for energy-consuming proteins embedded in the plasma membrane, responsible for membrane deformation and cell movement. In our model, the active particle overturns local valleys of the interface into hills, simulating growth, while itself sliding and seeking new valleys. In one dimension, this “overturn-slide-search” dynamics of the active particle causes it to move superdiffusively in the transverse direction while pulling the immobile interface upward. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we find an emerging tentlike mean profile developing with time, despite large fluctuations. The roughness of the interface follows scaling with the growth, dynamic, and roughness exponents, derived using simple arguments as beta = 2/3, z = 3/2, and alpha = 1/2, respectively, implying a breakdown of the usual scaling law beta = alpha/z, due to very local growth of the interface. The transverse displacement of the puller on the interface scales as~t^{2/3} and the probability distribution of its displacement is bimodal, with an unusual linear cusp at the origin. Both the mean interface pattern and probability distribution display scaling. A puller on a static two-dimensional interface also displays aspects of scaling in the mean profile and probability distribution. We also show that a pusher on a fluctuating interface moves subdiffusively leading to a separation of timescale in pusher motion and interface response.
