abstract: "In this study, we consider a spatial infectious disease model under Opportunistic epidemics which allows for the continuous contribution of extracellular compartments. We show that the proposed model has a unique steady state that is asymptotically stable. Using an appropriately constructed Lyapunov functional, we establish its global asymptotic stability. Numerical results obtained through MATLAB simulations are presented to confirm the theoretical findings of this study."
