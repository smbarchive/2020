abstract: "Protein aggregation poses major health challenges for humans, but instead confer beneficial phenotypes for yeast. However, experiments on yeast systems necessarily involve multiple scales cell/colony. In this talk, I describe efforts towards linking these scales with mathematical models.

More specifically, propagon counting assays reflect the intracellular amplification process of prion aggregation coupled with cell-division. We model these experiments with generation and aggregate structured population models. Through an inverse problem formulation we attempt to infer the intracellular replication rates of these aggregates."
