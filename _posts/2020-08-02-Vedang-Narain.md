abstract: "The re-epithelialization of a wound is a critical phase in the healing process, the disruption of which can lead to hypertrophic scarring. An accurate simulation of collective eukaryotic cell migration is critical for the development of computational models of wound healing. Using an agent-based model, we explored the feasibility of leveraging modified boids mechanics and adaptive proliferation rules to replicate contact-based locomotion and inhibition. Cells in our centre-based in silico simulation migrated from the edges of the cutaneous wound and successfully restored 'skin' integrity. When compared to simulations incorporating random walk movements, our boids-based model appeared to generate an improved qualitative approximation of in vivo observations. These simple rules may be useful for replicating various instances of collective cell migration."
