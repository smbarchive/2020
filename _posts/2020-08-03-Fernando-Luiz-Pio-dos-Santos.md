abstract: "In this work, we developed a reaction-diffusion mathematical model to describe the spread of dengue infection in a two-dimensional computational domain. We aimed to understand how the disease spreads from a specific location to another, considering the diffusion coefficients of both infected populations, mosquitoes, and humans. Our contribution provides an in-depth analysis of the optimal control problem and it outlines a more explicit modeling framework based on real spatial-temporal data.
