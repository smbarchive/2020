abstract: "Human  action  fragments  the  natural  habitat  of  several  species  all  around the world.  Understanding the effects of fragmentation to ecosystems is key to elaborate the best policies to avoid species extinctions.  Therefore,  it is important  to  study  how  the  populations  and  ecosystems  respond  to  these kinds of changes in landscapes.  In this work, we use numerical methods to simulate reaction-diffusion equations in artificial landscapes generated with different structural distributions while keeping the total amount of habitat constant.  This guarantees we are observing phenomena caused by fragmentation per se. We  discuss  the  net  effects  of  fragmentation  into  the  steady total population.  In order to do that correctly, we established the correlation between fragmentation metrics with fixed amount of habitat, to ensure that  conclusions  are  not  biased  by  interdependencies  of  metrics.   We  have also analytically calculated the critical size to allow population growth for bidimensional landscapes within our model, with given symmetries.  These results prove that habitat area is not the only factor when it comes to population settling, and hence patch shape matters.  Recent explorations on our model revel the presence of different movement scales, intra-patch and inter-patches.   Future  prospects  of  this  project  are  studying  how  fragmentation affects  features  of  population  spatial  distribution  and  investigations  about regimes of fragmentation that allow non-interactive (or weakly interacting) subpopulations to form.  We will also explore consequences of fragmentation to communities."
