title: "Persistence of intraguild predation in a 1D finite domain using variational approximations"
subgroup: "POPD"

abstract: "Fragmentation of the natural landscapes due to human activity has an undeniable undeniable eundeniable effect over the wildlife. The most known example being deforestation and the subsequent extinction of forest inhabiting species. In this context, a natural question to ask is: what is the minimum habitat size that allows for (co)existence of the species living in a given environment? The work described here then sought to address this inquiry for the particular case of 3 ecologically interacting species: a prey, its predator and a common resource. A system known as an intraguild predation module. We proposed and studied a model consisting of 3 coupled reaction-di_x000B_usion partial differential equations. In addition to numerical simulations, we used a method of approximation based on variational principles capable of providing analytical estimates for critical habitat sizes for the coexistence of the species involved in the proposed model.
