abstract: "In this study, we construct new variations of replicator systems, which include experimentally observed properties of living systems. First, we analyze a quasispecies system with niche diversification and mutator effect.  We examine the case with different fitness landscapes in the first and second habitats and migration flow between them.  It is shown that such systems have rich phase structure, governed by the transition and mutation rates. Second,  we focus on such modifications of classical models of microbiological evolution that include explicit specification on nutrition type. For the cases with one and multiple common nutrients, the evolutionary dynamics of the population is discussed."
