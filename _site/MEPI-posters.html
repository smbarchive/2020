Enderling@moffitt. org. 									1. Where will eSMB2020 take place?: 	  	   				The eSMB2020 conference will be held virtually. Through partnership with MathDept. org, we will utilize Sococo, Zoom, and Slack to create an immersive conference experience. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  2. What are the registration costs?: 	  	   				The registration fee is $25 for our first virtual annual meeting. You must register for the meeting through the registration website. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  3. Do I need to register if I am not presenting a poster or abstract?: 	  	   				Yes, registration is required for participation in eSMB2020. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									4. What the poster requirements?: 	  	   				Registration is required to present a poster. Please register at your earliest convenience at smb2020. org/registration.  A tutorial video of the sococo platform is online for you to get a glimpse into what the virtual poster session will look and feel like ( http://smb2020. org/logistics/ ). Please follow the following guidelines: 													Poster dimensions: Max of 3' x 4/ (91cm x 122cm). 					Format: PDF only					File Size: Not to exceed 25MB. 					If necessary, here are instructions to reduce file size: https://www. wikihow. com/Reduce-PDF-File-Size. 					Please save your poster with the following File Name: Lastname_Firstname_XXXX. pdf, where XXXX is to be replaced by the identifier of the SMB subgroup the poster belongs to. XXXX = { CDEV, EDUC, IMMU, MEPI, NEUR, ONCO, MFBM, POPD, OTHE }. All subgroups (and corresponding codes) are listed on the subgroup page. 					Please upload your poster pdf to the Subgroup Google Drive folder that your subgroup chair emailed you. 															   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;																															  	  5. If I submitted my abstract to the Heidelberg ESMTB meeting, is it too late to transfer it to SMB2020?: 	  	   				If you have not yet transferred your abstract, please submit your abstract as a new abstract during eSMB2020 registration.  	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  6. Will the Heidelberg ESMTB meeting still take place?: 	  	   				ESMTB organizers plan to hold ESMTB in 2021 in Heidelberg. Unfortunately, this won’t be a joint meeting with the SMB. The SMB 2021 annual meeting will be held at UC Riverside. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  7. Will my talk be recorded or live-streamed?: 	  	   				The eSMB2020 conference offers the unprecedented opportunity to record talks for dissemination after the meeting. Live-streaming is currently not planned. During abstract submission, authors can select to opt in/out of recordings.  	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  8. Can I re-submit an updated abstract?: 	  	   				Yes. To submit an updated abstract, please coordinate with the SMB subgroup lead that your abstract belongs to. If your abstract does not belong to an SMB subgroup, please contact Torbjörn Lundh. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  9. Can I submit an abstract that is not affiliated with any subgroup?: 	  	   				Yes, during abstract submission you choose the option ‘none of the above’ for subgroup affiliation. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  10. Can we still organize minisymposia?: 	  	   				Please reach out to the SMB subgroup leaders that your minisymposium thematically belongs to to confirm if accommodations can be made for additional minisymopisia. Note: the mathematical oncology section is currently at capacity and cannot accept further MS submissions. Otherwise, if the MS thematically does not belong to a subgroup, please contact Torbjörn Lundh. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  11. When will I be notified about abstract selection?: 	  	   				All submitted abstract will be evaluated by the SMB Subgroups and conference scientific committee after the abstract submission deadline on July 15. Notification of abstract selection for poster or oral presentation will be sent before the end of July.  	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  12. I've completed the registration form, but did not submit an abstract yet. How do I submit my abstract post-registration?: 	  	   				You can send your title and abstract to the SMB Membership Team at membership@smb. org, and they will add it to your registration. 	   	  	  	  13. How do I format my virtual poster?: 	  	   				Posters should be landscape format and saved as a single page pdf, to ensure that everybody will be able to view it on their personal computer or tablet.  When designing your poster, please chose content and font size carefully to clearly communicate your research. All accepted posters will be uploaded to a shared drive for access through Sococo during the poster session. Details will be communicated in the next couple of weeks. 	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  			"

However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.     	  			&lt;/br&gt;									    	  Conference Schedule: 	        	    * all times are listed in US Eastern Time Zone.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

However, the drugs we typically use to treat these diseases target a single protein (e. g. anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for treating diabetic retinopathy) and disregard the fact that cells within tissues are highly heterogeneous and have individualized responses that contribute to the tissue-level outcomes. To bridge the gap between protein and multi-cell/tissue-levels, my lab develops agent-based computational models and uses them in combination with experimental approaches, to predict how individual cell behaviors give rise to tissue-level adaptations. We have used agent-based modeling to simulate the structural adaptations of large and small blood vessels, skeletal muscle regeneration following injury, and immune cell trafficking and differentiation during inflammation and infection. Our studies have suggested new mechanistic hypotheses and provided suggestions for the design of novel therapies that account for the dynamic and heterogeneous interactions between different cell types within a diseased tissue.

Trophic (consumer-resource) interactions, which comprise the fundamental units (modules) of food webs, are of particular importance because they have an intrinsic tendency to fluctuate in abundance, thus running to risk of stochastic extinction during periods of low abundances. Here I present a mathematical framework for predicting warming effects on consumer-resource interactions.  This work differs from previous theory in two important ways. First, it uses delay differential equations to realistically depict the developmental delays inherent in ectotherm life cycles, and incorporates mechanistic descriptions of phenotypic trait responses, derived from first principles of thermodynamics, into the dynamical delay model. Second, it investigates the recent IPCC predictions on the increase in the number of hotter-than-average days. I report three key results. First, across latitudes (tropical vs. temperate) and feeding strategies (juvenile vs. adult attacked), a greater increase in the maximum temperature compared to the minimum (hotter-than-average summers) is more detrimental to consumer-resource interactions than a greater increase in the minimum temperature (warmer-than-average winters).  Second, across latitude and warming scenarios, effects of warming are more detrimental when the consumer attacks the adult stage of the resource.  Third, across warming scenarios and feeding strategies, consumer-resource interactions in the tropics are more at risk of species losses due to warming while those in the temperate zone are more at risk of extreme fluctuations in species' abundances. I discuss implications of these results for biodiversity and biological pest control. 				     			    			   		    		    		  									{% include happy_hour. html %}						&lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									 				 {% include schedule_menu. html %}			 																				      	      		      														Click to show abstracts											      	            "

Cell and developmental biology has long proven a fertile ground for mathematical modelling and, with recent advances in microscopy, image analysis, and fluorescent reporter methods, it is becoming an increasingly quantitative discipline. We are now able to constrain mathematical models of developmental processes, for example through parameter estimation, increasing the potential of such models to be used in a predictive way. The objective of this Subgroup is to accelerate these efforts, by supporting and advancing the use of mathematical modelling as part of the ‘toolkit’ of cell and developmental biology.

In the brain, levels of acetylcholine change with activity. For example, acetylcholine is higher during waking and REM sleep and low during slow wave sleep.  In this talk we show how the M-current affects the bifurcation structure of a generic conductance-based neural model and how this determines synchronization properties of the model. We then use phase-model analysis to study the effect of a slowly varying M-current on synchronization. This is joint work with Victoria Booth, Xueying Wang and Isam Al-Darbasah.

The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this novel coronavirus.  Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5 infected patients hospitalized with severe disease.  Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0. 7 to 9 ng/mL.  Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are quite immunogenic.  In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike.  Cyro-electron microscopy structures of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two RBDs revealed recognition of the closed, “all RBD-down” conformation of the spike.  Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.

Apical constriction is a ubiquitous cell shape change of epithelial tissues that promotes epithelia folding and cell/tissue invagination in a variety of contexts.  Apical constriction promotes tissue bending by changing the shape of constituent cells from a columnar-shape to a wedge-shape.  Drosophila gastrulation is one of the classic examples of apical constriction, where cells constrict to fold the primitive epithelial sheet and internalize cells that will give rise to internal organs. We have used a combination of imaging, experimental perturbation, and modeling, to determine how actomyosin organization promotes tissue folding.  The actin cytoskeleton is organized in both time and space to facilitate apical constriction.  We found that actomyosin contraction is pulsatile and requires dynamic regulation of upstream signaling processes. In addition, we found that actomyosin becomes organized into oriented fibers, which generates anisotropic tension that is critical for tissue shape.  Furthermore, connectivity within the network of actomyosin fibers is highly redundant, promoting the robustness of folding.

Most people think they have pretty good bullshit detectors, at least when it comes to advertising hyperbole, weasel words, and politicians’ promises. Quantitative claims are harder: Numbers have the sense of objectivity and precision, and people feel less confident in challenging them. Yet with COVID-19, quantitative epidemiology is on the front page of every newspaper on every day of the week. Shortly before the pandemic broke out, I finished a book on how to spot and refute quantitative misinformation. Every lesson in the book has proven useful during the current pandemic. In this talk, I will present a tour of how misleading numbers, statistics, mathematics, and data graphics have muddied the social and traditional media streams that we all rely upon during COVID. I will give examples of deliberate disinformation, and examples of unintended misinformation around the pandemic. And I will explore how as citizens and as educators we all can promote data reasoning and quantitative literacy. 				     			    			   		    		    		    		  									&lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									 				 {% include schedule_menu. html %}			 																	      		      									Click to show abstracts						            "

In a tumor, neighboring subclonal cancer cell populations interact both through competition for resources and through cooperation, by the production of growth promoting signals. Promoting competition can maintain drug sensitivity when resistant cells get outcompeted. Cooperation can promote cell survival under selective pressure, as well as potentially protect cellular populations that may otherwise be susceptible to treatment. Our research program integrates three key components to quantify cancer cell interactions: serial patient tumor samples molecularly profiled at the single cell level, a parallel in vitro model system where mechanisms can be tested through experimental manipulation and measured over time, and integrative dynamic mathematical models of the growth and interaction of subclonal cancer populations. By embedding the time course data and differential equation models into a Bayesian inference framework, we can estimate the strength of positive and negative interactions between subclonal populations during treatment and identify key mechanisms driving cell communication. Our analyses of patient derived samples further indicates that heterogeneous multi-clonal ER+ breast cell populations evolve to acquire alternative signaling states that drive cell cycle progression independent of estrogen availability, and that cells can cooperate to survive during therapy through the increased production and local sharing of growth promoting factors. 					    				     			    			   		    		    		  									{% include happy_hour. html %}						&lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									 				 {% include schedule_menu. html %}			 											      		      									Click to show abstracts						            "

Many are confused, rely on less than reliable sources for information, and reject scientific authorities equating the evolution of knowledge to lack of expertise. Given the current situation: what is our role and responsibility as educators to help our students be more informed, critical thinkers? How must we empower them through education to identify reliable sources and to better understand the scientific process? In this talk, we will reflect on ways in which we can respond to the current knowledge deficit, and why it is our duty to do so.

Chemotaxis is important to many of the things cells do in vivo, particularly during development and disease. It is also a favourite topic for mathematical biologists. However, despite decades of studies of how cells can interpret chemotactic gradients, there has been very little attention to how gradients form, and where the information comes from. We have studied a particularly interesting aspect of this problem - self-generated gradients, in which cells form their own gradients at the same time as interpreting them and migrating up them. Self-generated gradients are fascinating, and ideal for mathematical biologists - they are so dynamic that they are nearly impossible to measure, and they incorporate multiple levels of feedback. I will describe how we use modelling, mathematics and experiments on Dictyostelium and cancer cells to understand different self-generated gradients. In particular I will show how cells can solve arbitrarily complex mazes, escape from tumours, and use the information in a gradient to move down-gradient as well as up-gradient. 					    				     			    			   		    		    		  									{% include happy_hour. html %}						&lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									 				 {% include schedule_menu. html %}			 											      		      									Click to show abstracts						            "

The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

    "body": "2020/06/08 - Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. We will probably remember these days, in years to come, as a true opportunity to contribute to the global fight against the pandemic. Predictive mathematical models that capture the underlying mechanistic biology of specific processes are at the heart of everything we do. The COVID-19 virus pandemic has brought into sharp focus the critical importance of mathematical models in both making predictions about current trends in the disease dynamics but also how specific interventions, such as social distancing, might modify them. Understanding these interventions theoretically becomes important not only for mathematical biologists, but also for politicians and other decision makers. Most of the our society members are currently doing some form of social distancing, as is a large proportion of the world. In these confined and difficult times, anxiety and stress are running high. But it is important to remember that we have the power of mathematical modelling behind us. Their predictive ability illustrates why we must slowdown the spread of this virus by staying home. Flattening the curve has become our new mantra. Importantly mathematical modelling will also help us decide how to best end this quarantine. We are at a key point in the history of our society where our models are helping to inform policy decisions that impact millions of lives. Therefore it is fundamental that we make every effort to articulate as clearly as possible what mathematical models are, what they can be used for, and what are their limitations. The integration of mathematics and biology may sound strange at first to the public. But if you find yourself in a situation where you need to explain why certain decisions are being made, please take the time to do so. Articulate the role of predictive mathematical models, but not as something magical, even though they might seem so at times. Rather that they are based on our understanding of the physical and biological processes that underly the spread of this disease. We are a diverse group of scientists and educators who work at the interface of many disciplines not just epidemiology. Our society does have a dedicated subgroup in Mathematical Epidemiology and I encourage you join them if you are interested in this area of research or if you want to learn more. We also have 7 other subgroups covering everything from development to oncology and more - I’m extremely proud of our research diversity. The purpose of this email was to shine a little light and say thank you, to celebrate the wonderful discipline we are part of and highlight the important role mathematical models are playing right now. We are fortunate in many ways, with our ability to more readily work from home than most disciplines. We can make predictions about disease dynamics without ever actually treating a patient or being forced to make difficult decisions in medical care. We can run thousands of realisations of an experiment in a fraction of the time it would take in real life. We can make rigorously constrained predictions about the spread of an epidemic and how to slow it down. Ultimately the countermeasures needed to control and end this pandemic will rely on biomedical research on drugs and vaccines. But again, their impact can and should be studied through the lens of mathematical modelling. I would be remiss if I didn’t give a special thanks to our colleagues, friends and family members in the medical profession. Without their frontline action flattening the curve becomes meaningless. Stay safe, stay home and celebrate mathematical biology! -Sandy Anderson, SMB President "

						    			We present a study of the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan. Important transmission pathways such as the role of Asymptomatic, Quarantined and Isolated individuals are incorporated in the model. The model is then used to study the outbreak in Pakistan, considering the different lockdown and social distancing measures taken at different times by the health authorities noting that the epidemic curve in Pakistan has been quite different from those in Europe and the US, with a significantly lower disease burden and mortality rate.

						    			Malaria is a life-threatening mosquito-borne disease. It is transmitted through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. People who get infected with malaria become very sick with high fevers, chills, and flu-like symptoms. Malaria may be fatal if not treated promptly. Here we propose an SIS model to study the trans- mission dynamics of malaria with saturated treatment. We assume that the mosquito population is growing logistically in the environment. Here we include a saturated type treatment function which is more suitable for the regions with limited resources. We discuss the existence and stability of different equilibria of the proposed model. We also compute the basic reproduction number R0 which plays an important role in existence and stability of equilibria of the model. We estimate the parameter corresponding to transmission of malaria using real data from different states of India by least square method. We also perform sensitivity analysis using PRCC to identify the key parameters which influence the basic reproduction number and system both, hence regulate the transmission dynamics of malaria. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the analytic findings.

						    			Mathematical models can integrate different components of an infectious disease to reveal novel insights into the long-term effects. Conventional models focus either on pathogen infection (in-host scale) or pathogen transmission (between-host scale). However, we have yet to establish a framework that unites the two scales. We employ a conceptual modeling approach, where the standard transmission parameter becomes a function of the viral load, coupling in-host virus kinetics with an immune response to a compartmental disease model. The stability of the steady states with simulations cast light on the extent of a chronic host infection to influence the severity of an outbreak. Our results lend support to the 'multiscale' paradigm of disease modeling, which can inform long-term, personalized, and data-driven strategies in disease control and healthcare.

						    			The control of contacts among individuals and across regions is of paramount importance to understand the dynamics of infectious diseases. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, many infectious individuals are asymptomatic, thereby raising the question as to whether limiting contacts with infected individuals displaying symptoms is sufficient to control the spread of the disease.


To this end, we have developed a mathematical model, called SAIRD model, that includes susceptible individuals (S), asymptomatic infectious individuals (A), infectious individuals displaying symptoms (I), individuals who recovered (R) and deceased individuals (D). The model also includes mobility of individuals across geographic regions that accounts for inter-region travel patterns.


We have considered 3 regions characterized by different inter-individual contacts. Specifically, no limitations are adopted in region 1, limitations are adopted only for symptomatic individuals in region 2, and limitations are adopted for both asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals in region 3. In the absence of inter-region connection, the model predicts similar disease dynamics in regions 1 and 2, whereas region 3 experiences a notable lower number of infections and death. These results suggest that controlling inter-individual contacts in both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases is essential to contain the disease dynamics. Furthermore, the model predicts that controlling inter-individual contacts without controlling inter-region connections may nullify the gains.

						    			Although vaccine has proven to be the best preventive method to reduce risk of flu infection, the coverage often remains below the herd-immunity level due to individuals’ perceptions towards the vaccination and the severity of disease outbreak. This, however, brings challenges to public health for strategic decision-making in controlling flu outbreak every year. To understand the impact of behavioral issues on public health decision-making to control flu, we define vaccination decision in population as a two-strategy pairwise-contest game and integrate with the disease process model to consider vaccination during a flu outbreak. We use optimal control theory to identify the best possible strategy for public health to reduce infection at a minimum cost. Our analysis shows that the cost of public health initiatives can be minimized by putting the effort in the beginning and end of the outbreak rather than during the peak. We also consider vaccination with evolving risk perception and infection with high severity such as disease-induced death. Our model demonstrates a feed-forward mechanism in the dynamics of vaccination and exhibits an increase in vaccine uptake as the risk perception decreases with more coverage. It confers that public health effort towards disseminating disease severity or actual vaccination risk might accelerate the vaccination coverage and mitigate the infection faster.

						    			We consider a stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model with contact tracing on random trees and on the configuration model. On a rooted tree, where initially all individuals are susceptible apart from the root which is infected, we are able to find exact formulas for the distribution of the infectious period. Thereto, we show how to extend the existing theory for contact tracing in homogeneously mixing populations to trees. Based on these formulas, we discuss the influence of randomness in the tree and the basic reproduction number. We find the well known results for the homogeneously mixing case as a limit of the present model (tree-shaped contact graph). Furthermore, we develop approximate mean field equations for the dynamics on trees, and – using the message passing method – also for the configuration model. The interpretation and implications of the results are discussed.

						    			Cholera, an acute gastrointestinal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, continues to be a major threat to public health with an estimated 1.3 - 4 million cases reported annually. The majority of existing cholera models focus on the between-host dynamics independent of within-host dynamics, a factor that downplays the interdependence of the two processes on the spread of the infection. In this study, an immuno-epidemiological model for cholera is formulated to analyze the effect of within- host dynamics on the population. The model is an adaptation of the immuno-epidemiological models reviewed by M. Martcheva, N. Tuncer, C. St Mary (2015). We use time-scale methods to distinguish the dynamics of the immune response and the parasite load of an individual. A thorough bifurcation analysis reveals the existence of a saddle node and Hopf bifurcation. In contrast to other immunological models, the present approach allows for clearance of the pathogen after a finite time. The between- host system is represented by a size structured model with the pathogen load considered as the linking mechanism. We derive expressions for the reproduction number and conduct stability analysis of the equilibria. Conclusions about the interdependence of the two dynamics on disease spread are drawn from the analysis.

						    			Rumours on adverse health outcomes either from infection or vaccination have strong impact on vaccination uptake. Understanding human behavioral responses during a vac- cine scare and its interactions with the population dynamics of disease play key role in predicting the dynamics of disease, designing intervention strategies and policymaking in public health program. Mathematical modelling is an important tool for investigating and quantifying such effects in infectious disease and control. In the first part of my talk, I will introduce evolutionary game models of vaccination dynamics in homogeneous population to describe how human attitude changes towards vaccination during a scare using empirical data of several vaccination coverage. In the second part, I will introduce vaccination game on social network to discuss how rare but severe events can impact the vaccination dynamics.

						    			The measles control programme in Kenya is considered to be at it end phase. There has been long-term high level coverage of measles containing vaccine (MCV) at 9m reaching around 90% in 2010-12. Supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are undertaken periodically (last done in 2016) to reduce the build-up of susceptibles in the age range 9m to 14 years. However, sporadic outbreaks continue, and data suggests vaccine uptake of MCV dose 1 has decreased over the last 5 years (WHO & UNICEF 2017, Manakongtreecheep & Davis 2017). A second dose of MCV was introduced in 2013 at 18months of age, but coverage is only at around 35%, and there is little confidence that this can easily be improved. There is national case-based surveillance, with follow up, through IgM serology from cases of rash illness. This study seeks to understand the possible reasons for continued outbreaks and to predict the implications of various vaccine strategies by modelling the Spatio-temporal risk of measles outbreaks and options for their control in Kenya.

						    			COVID-19 disease has become a pandemic just a few months after it was first detected. Ecuador has reported one of the highest rates of COVID-19 in Latin America, with more than 62,000 cases and 8,500 deaths in a country of approximately 17 million people. The dynamics of the outbreak is being observed quite different in different provinces of Ecuador with high reported prevalence in some low population density provinces. In this study, we aim to understand the variations in outbreaks between provinces and provide assistance in essential preparedness planning in order to respond effectively to ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. This study estimated the critical level of quarantine rate along with corresponding leakage in order to avoid overwhelming the local health care system. The results suggest that provinces with high population density can avoid a large disease burden provided they initiate early and stricter quarantine measures even under low isolation rate. To best of our knowledge, this study is first from the region to determine which provinces will need much preparation for current outbreak in fall and which might need more help.

						    			The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on multiple levels of society. Not only has the pandemic completely overwhelmed some health systems but it has also changed how scientific evidence is shared and increased the pace at which such evidence is published and consumed, by scientists, policymakers and the wider public. With very little experimental scientific evidence, predictive mathematical models have played an increasingly prominent role advising policymakers, even in low- and middle-income countries, such as Brazil. Through the COVID-19 Modelling (CoMo) Consortium, an international group of infectious disease modellers and public health experts collaborated to create a modelling interface that could help simulating the effect of different non-pharmaceutical interventions on mitigating the epidemic in numerous locations. Here, we describe how we adapted this modelling framework to the Brazilian context and, more specifically, to the city of Sao Paulo.

						    			There exist individuals that change their sexual behavior depending on the situation or at different stages in their life. A possibly common and transient example of situational sexuality is the person who self-identifies as heterosexual, but will sexually interact with a member of the same sex when lacking other opportunities. Less transient but also possibly common, a person who self-identifies as gay or lesbian (either at the time, or later) may sexually interact with a member of the opposite sex if a same-sex relationship seems unfeasible, Thompson 2008, [1]. HIV/AIDS transmission usually considers sexual contact in heterosexual and homosexual population separately, besides in sexual transmission the same format for men and women is assumed. Thus, Can the population be split in heterosexuals and homosexual and thus the group of bisexuals be ignored? Can the sexual transmission form be equal for men and women? What is the contribution of a bisexual group in the HIV transmission? and, How to consider sexual transmission in men and women according to sexual behavior? To try to answer these questions we proposed an original mathematical model considering bisexuals in the HIV transmission. Mathematical analysis undertaken and stationary points, stability analysis of disease free equilibrium and boundary equilibrium, the basic reproductive number is obtained and discussed through the next generation method; numerical simulations show that these casual contacts between bisexuals has less influence than homosexual case.

						    			Background: Global spread of COVID-19 created an unprecedented infectious disease crisis that progressed to a pandemic with >180,000 cases in >100 countries. Reproductive number (R) is an outbreak metric estimating the transmission of a pathogen. Initial R values were published based on the early outbreak in China with limited number of cases with whole genome sequencing. Initial comparisons failed to show a direct relationship viral genomic diversity and epidemic severity was not established for SARS-Cov-2. Methods: Each country's COVID-19 outbreak status was classified according to epicurve stage (index, takeoff, exponential, decline). Instantaneous R estimates (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval examined asymptomatic spread. Whole genome sequences were used to quantify the pathogen genome identity score that were used to estimate transmission time and epicurve stage. Transmission time was estimated based on evolutionary rate of 2 mutations/month. Findings: The country-specific R revealed variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak stages. Outside China, R estimates revealed propagating epidemics poised to move into the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had variable relationship to the outbreaks. GENI scores differentiated countries in index stage with cryptic transmission. Integration of incidence data with genome variation directly increases in cases with increased genome variation. Interpretation: R was dynamic for each country and during the outbreak stage. Integrating the outbreak dynamic, dynamic R, and genome variation found a direct association between cases and genome variation. Synergistically, GENI provides an evidence-based transmission metric that can be determined by sequencing the virus from each case. We calculated an instantaneous country-specific R at different stages of outbreaks and formulated a novel metric for infection dynamics using viral genome sequences to capture gaps in untraceable transmission. Integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing allows evidence-based dynamic disease outbreak tracking with predictive evidence.

						    			Individual based modeling of disease transmission (IBM) offers an attractive alternative to population based approaches e.g. (continuous DE), as it allows a detailed account of biological (risk) factors, environment, and behavior. This is particularly relevant in local community settings (hospital, workplace, school, city district or county), where finite population size and host heterogeneity, in terms social interactions and disease progression, make a ‘continuous approach’ impractical. We develop such IBM methodology to simulate Covid-19 outbreaks in local settings, and explore different control-mitigation strategies. Our models feature multiple disease pathways (asymptomatic, mild and severe) typical of Covid-19, as well as heterogeneous host communities with different susceptibility levels and structured social contacts. Individual hosts undergo SEIR disease progression (Susceptible, Exposed - presymptomatic, Infected-symptomatic, Recovered) of variable stage-duration and infectivity. The crucial (S->E) transition is determined by host ‘contact-pool’ on daily basis. Unlike conventional social-contact network (‘one-to-one’ transmission), our setup features ‘many-to-many’ (multigraph) transmission. Two typical IBM examples include (i) hospital, made of interacting healthcare workers (HCW) and patients, (ii) school/college, where students + staff aggregate in classrooms, dorms and engage in other (social, sport) activities. In both cases, we used available data (a hospital in Wuhan, a college in US) to set up and calibrate our models. Different control/mitigation strategies were explored, including symptomatic and asymptomatic testing and isolation, use of PPE (hospital), social distancing, and contact tracing (college). We assessed the efficacy of each intervention, and resources required to prevent or mitigate the outbreak.

						    			Many methods exists for generating networks with certain pre-specified properties. However, there are network properties that arise in certain applications for which we don't have standard methods. For example, age or sub-population structure in biological applications can be a very important determinant of node connectivity, but methods for constructing networks with a given structure are still being developed. In this talk, I will discuss a method we developed for generating an age-structured human interaction network using survey data that summarizes the number of interactions between individuals within and between different age groups. We do this using the well-known POLYMOD dataset to construct an age-structured infectious disease transmission network.

						    			Tuberculosis, a lethal infectious disease attribute among the top 10 causes of death globally and leading cause of death from a single infectious pathogen (rank before HIV). The sputum smear-microscopy and chest X-ray are the key TB diagnosis methods available in resource-constrained health settings of many developing countries. The specificity of the diagnostic method is satisfactory whereas, sensitivity is limited and cannot detect pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) cases below a bacterial load of 1000 organism/ml. According to the sensitivity of this diagnostic method,  PTB patients are categorized into two kinds: (a) smear-positive and (b) smear-negative. Interestingly, this categorization also scales the infectivity of PTB patients in the community. Our current study addresses this heterogeneity in the infectiousness of PTB individuals to investigate its consequences in disease dynamics.
A five-dimensional compartmental model is formulated considering the infectivity of both the smear-positive and negative PTB individuals. The expression of the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) is obtained through the next-generation matrix method. The asymptotic behaviour of the model is thoroughly discussed around the steady states of the proposed model. The global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points is established using suitably constructed Lyapunov functions. It is observed that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for $R_0<1$ and the disease-persistent equilibrium point is the same whenever $R_0>1$. The study also provides a list of normalized forward sensitivity indices of $R_0$ with respect to the involved parameters. This list showcases the influential level of the associated parameters in determining the size of the threshold quantity $R_0$. It has been found that neglecting the transmission capacity of the smear-negative individuals underestimates the value of $R_0$ whereas, ignoring the smear-negative compartment overestimates the same quantity. We also implement numerical simulations whenever necessary, using a suitable TB parameter set to visualize the obtained analytical results.

						    			Midge-borne arboviruses were once restricted to other geographical regions; however due to climate change and increased globalisation these diseases now pose a threat to the UK, with outbreaks having already occurred. African horse sickness virus (AHSV) is endemic in parts of Africa. An outbreak in Spain 1987-1990, which spread to Portugal and Morocco, demonstrated the ability of this virus to spread within Europe.
A previously published model suggested an ordinary differential equation model for AHSV in which parameters were derived from three published studies. In order to better inform the model studies documenting experimental infection of equids in vaccination trials were systematically reviewed. As we were interested in modelling emergence of AHSV in a naive population, only experimental infections of control (i.e. naive) animals were considered. Parameters derived from the systematic review were the time until the onset of viraemia, clinical signs and death after experimental infection of a naive equid. The mean latent period of horses was found to be 4.6 days, longer than previously estimated (3.7 days). The infectious periods of dying and surviving hosts were found to be 3.9 and 8.7 days, whereas previous estimations where 4.4 and 6 days, respectively. The host mortality rate was also found to be higher than previous estimations. Model simulations were compared for the previously published models parameters and an updated set of parameter values derived from the systematic review and other literature. The updated parameter values resulted in an increase in the number of host deaths and decrease in the duration of the outbreak. We also observed many more vector infections in simulations using the updated parameters. Sensitivity analysis showed that the host latent period and vector to host ratio had the greatest impact on simulation outputs.
The vector parameters in this model were also updated using literature. However, many of these were from studies on american vector species. Therefore, the stages of this work involve fitting a model developed for the vector populations to UK trap data.

						    			A challenging problem in infectious disease modelling is assessing when a disease has been eliminated. Control campaigns have substantial economic consequences; as such there are high demands to reduce costs and reallocate resources. However, if campaigns are stopped prematurely it can result in disease resurgence and subsequently put control efforts back by decades. Early-warning signals offer a computationally inexpensive technique to monitor the progress towards elimination, using statistical indicators calculated on time series data.
Early-warning signals are widely used in many fields to anticipate a critical threshold prior to reaching it. A system undergoes the phenomenon known as critical slowing down as it crosses through a threshold. Theory predicts that fluctuations away from the mean will recover more slowly as the system approaches a critical transition (Scheffer et al., 2009). This is key in infectious disease modelling to assess when the basic reproduction number is reduced below the threshold of one.
Recent theoretical advances have shown indicators of critical transitions in epidemiology such as measuring the variance in synthetic disease data. Our work highlights several challenges when applying this theory in practice. One potential problem is known as 'detrending' the data, which can be difficult to achieve in a single time series (Dessavre & Southall et al., 2019). Accurately detrending the signal removes the mean to obtain the fluctuations, whilst preserving any statistical properties.  We present a novel approach using a metapopulation framework to successfully detrend data using the mean of different geographical subpopulations.
A second limitation is that often only incidence-level data is available publicly. However, current theoretical analyses of statistical indicators concentrate on prevalence data, instead of new cases. We demonstrate that indicators calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data (Southall et al., 2020). Inconsistencies in time series traits between different diseases systems and a variety of disease data types could lead to misleading results when applied to collected data.
In this talk we present methods for dealing with the typical data collected and our results show promising methods for calculating early-warning signals of elimination on real-world noisy data.

						    			With one of the longest lockdowns in the world and over 50,000 cases and 1,600 deaths, the Philippines is one of the hardest hit countries of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Southeast Asian region as of July 2020. The country continues to realign its lockdown policies and increase its test-trace-and-treat capacity to control the epidemic while trying to ease the burden on the national economy. In this study, we identify the best strategy to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 for the regions with the highest cases in the Philippines by applying optimal control theory to a nonlinear dynamical model fitted to local epidemiological data. Furthermore, long-term viability of different levels of community quarantine, testing, and combinations of these two strategies to minimize the number of infectious individuals are examined through cost effectiveness analysis given the limited resources available to the country.

						    			This paper examine the impact of transmission rate and vaccination on the dynamics of tuberculosis infection. Model analysis is established, the existence of hopf-bifurcation is analytically shown which deduces the oscillatory persistence of the infection in the population. The stability properties of the steady states and its bifurcation structures are investigated. We illustrate that there exist threshold values for the transmission rate and vaccination which corresponds to saddle node, transcritical and subcritical hopf bifurcation.

						    			The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has dramatically increased the public awareness and appreciation of the utility of dynamic models. At the same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has highlighted their limitations.  If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot be determined from out-put measurements, its ability to yield correct insights – as well as the possibility of controlling the system – maybe compromised.  Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many variations of such models have been used for analysing and predicting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In this paper we survey the different models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and assessing their ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem using the control theoretic concepts of structural identifiability and observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic, we consider boththe constant and time-varying parameter assumptions.  We analyse the structural identifiability and observability ofall of the models, considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which leads us to analyse 255 different model versions. We classify the models according to their structural identifiability and observability under the different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also illustrate with an example several alternative ways of remedying the lack of observability of a model. Our analyses provide guidelines for choosing themost informative model for each purpose, taking into account the available knowledge and measurements.

						    			We study and present an approach based on artificial neural networks to forecast the number of cases with the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The number of cases of RSV in most of the countries around the world present a seasonal type behavior. We construct and develop several multilayer perceptron models that intend to forecast appropriately the number of cases of RSV. We compared our approach with a classical technique for time series, and our results are more accurate. The adjusted MLP network that we find has a fairly high accuracy of forecast.  Finally, we compare empirical and mechanistic models applied to forecasting and prediction.

						    			Since its introduction in 1927 by Kermack and McKendrick, SIR compartmental models have been the basis of mathematical epidemiology. In this work we consider a SIRS epidemics on a system of mobile agents, which can interact during a finite period of time that depends on their dynamics. Thus, as the probability of disease transmission depends on this contact time, the spatial dynamics will strongly influence the disease evolution. By combining individual-based simulations and mean-field arguments, we study the dependency of the equilibrium populations on motility parameters, specifically the active speed and tumbling frequency. We find that the equilibrium epidemic size exhibits two very distinct, non-trivial scaling regimes with the motility parameters, depending on whether the system is in the ballistic or diffusive regime. Our mean-field estimates lead to an effective renormalization of the transition rates that allow building a phase-diagram that separates endemic and disease free phases. We find an excellent agreement between numerical simulations and mean-field estimates.

						    			Researchers have noted that there are unexpectedly few SARS-CoV-2 coinfections with other circulating respiratory viruses. We use an in host mathematical model to examine interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses, finding that SARS-CoV-2 growth tends to be blocked by the presence of other viruses. We then formulate an epidemiological model to determine how this blocking effect might influence the impending second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

						    			Malaria is a vector (mosquito)-borne parasitic disease, which is a major cause of death and disability in the world around the equatorial belt. The mosquitoes require a range of temperature and humidity to reproduce and persist, and the Malaria parasite (species of Plasmodium) uses both mosquito and human as their host for growth and reproduction. The cooler regions, such as the cold high altitude mountainous areas, therefore, witness fewer Malaria cases. An increase in temperature, as a possible consequence of global warming, is hypothesized to drive the spread of the malarial vectors to higher altitudes, by rendering these regions suitable for their growth, and consequent increase in Malaria incidence. But this view is hotly debated with evidence existing both against and in favour. Therefore, there is a need for more empirical evidence covering a wide variety of regions all around the world. A detailed study is performed, on a historical dataset (1975-1995) of Malaria cases in 19 contiguous districts from the three north-western states of India having an altitude higher than 1000 meters, for the analysis of the impact of temperature changes on Malaria incidence in these high altitude regions. In reality, the mean temperatures do not show a consistent increase over the years, and the vegetation, rainfall, and other environmental and demographic factors also differ among the regions and years. Using different data analytic and statistical measures, the results, though collectively do not provide a definite evidence for climate change-induced increase in Malaria in the high altitude regions under study, yet they do point towards increased malaria cases with an increase in temperature. It also points out that many other drivers may be responsible for the spread of an infectious disease like Malaria (e.g., population density, tourism, water bodies, agricultural land-use, etc.), which needs to be considered. This argues in favour of considering epidemiological data from a more interdisciplinary perspective by including demographic, environmental, social and economic driving factors in analysis and modelling.

						    			World Health Organization (WHO) defined coronaviruses (CoV) as a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV).The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. In this work is presented a mathematical model that describes the transmission of Covid-19. The model considers both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Several studies showed the importance of asymptomatic people in the disease transmission. This is a predictive model, we look at different scenarios, first of all assuming any prevention to avoid the diffusion of the virus is taken and secondly different scenarios where precautionary measures to avoid contact between people are taken, such as quarantine and social distancing. We consider a measures to contain the disease, already studied for a predator-prey systems with the disease in the prey population assuming that the infection rate can be decreased avoiding contacts between preys (people in our case). From the numerical results we get that avoiding contacts helps to delay the peak of the maximum number of infected people, that is important in those cases where the hospital system does not have enough seats in the intensive care unit. Furthermore we studied how the reproduction number depends on the parameters values of the model. Some of the parameters are fixed, as found in literature for Italy, while other are used as control parameters.

						    			As a pandemic of coronavirus spreads across the globe, people debate policies to mitigate its severity. Many complex, highly detailed models have been developed to help policy setters make better decisions. However, the basis of these models is unlikely to be understood by non-experts. We describe the advantages of simple models for covid-19. We say a model is ' simple' if its only parameter is the rate of contact between people in the population. This contact rate can vary over time, depending on choices by policy setters. Such models can be understood by a broad audience, and thus can be helpful in explaining the policy decisions to the public. They can be used to evaluate outcomes of different policy strategies. However, simple models have a disadvantage when dealing with inhomogeneous populations. To augment the power of a simple model to evaluate complicated situations, we add what we call 'satellite' equations that do not change the original model.  For example, with the help of a satellite equation, one could know what his/her chance is of remaining uninfected through the end of epidemic. Satellite equations can model the effect of the epidemic on high-risk individuals, or death rates, or on nursing homes, and other isolated populations. To compare simple models with complex models, we introduce our 'slightly complex' Model J. We find the conclusions of simple and complex models can be quite similar. But, for each added complexity, a modeler may have to choose additional parameter values describing who will infect whom under what conditions, choices for which there is often little rationale but that can have a big impact on predictions. Our simulations suggest that the added complexity offers little predictive advantage.

						    			Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by 	extit{Schistosoma japonicum}, is one of the neglected tropical diseases and remains endemic in the Philippines, covering 28 provinces in 12 regions. Unlike other species of 	extit{Schistosoma}, 	extit{Schistosoma japonicum} is a zoonotic parasite which infects other mammalian hosts aside from humans. With that nature of the parasite, we construct a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis in Agusan del Sur, Philippines. Here, we consider humans and carabaos as definitive hosts, and snails as intermediate hosts. We conduct stability analysis on the proposed model, and calculate for the basic reproduction number, $R_0$. We also perform sensitivity analysis using the Latin hypercube sampling combined with partial rank correlation coefficient technique to investigate how the number of infected humans is affected by the changes in model parameters. Using the available Philippine schistosomiasis data from the Department of Health, we estimate some model parameters. Finally, we apply optimal control theory to determine optimal strategies to control and prevent the spread of schistosomiasis in the country, which may eventually lead to the elimination of the disease.

						    			Early 2020 saw the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of July 14, 2020, there have been over 13 million confirmed cases worldwide, which have caused over 570K fatalities; in reality, the numbers are almost certainly much higher. As a vaccine has yet to be developed, social distancing as a form of a Nonpharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) has been enacted in many countries as a means of reducing the spread of the virus. Understanding the effects of social distancing to hopefully “flatten the curve” is fundamentally important in the design of reopening policies. In this work, we introduce a framework which explicitly models socially distanced populations via separate compartments: distancing regulations are modeled by flow rates between the distanced and non-distanced populations, and the overall reduction in transmissions due to distancing is also incorporated. In this way, both the response to distancing guidelines and their stringency can be explicitly modeled, and thus the control problem can be thought of as having two inputs from a policy-design perspective. We note that many authors have studied the control problem via reduction in transmission rate, whereas flow rate control has not been sufficiently analyzed; the latter is a focus of the current work. We compute the basic reproduction number R0, which characterizes the initial outbreak of the infection, and demonstrate that at sufficiently early stages of the pandemic when there is little immunity in the population, a quick implementation of social distancing is required in order for R0<1. We also find that R0 is sensitive to the fraction of infected individuals who become symptomatic (currently highly uncertain), illustrating the importance of obtaining a confident measurement of this value before quantitative model predictions can be trusted. Similarly, as it is currently unknown how infective asymptomatic carriers are, we investigate the dependence of R0 on distancing regulations (both flow rate and transmission reduction) as a function of the asymptomatic infection rate. Dynamic simulations of time-varying distancing guidelines also provide surprising results. We discover a critical implementation delay in issuing separation mandates. That is, there is a nontrivial but tight “window of opportunity” for commencing social distancing in order to meet the capacity of healthcare resources. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedule’s frequency. Furthermore, we consider the impact of steadily reducing social distancing measures over time. We find that a too-sudden reopening of society may negate the progress achieved under initial distancing guidelines (which is unfortunately playing out in real-time in the U.S.), but the negative effects can be mitigated if the relaxation strategy is carefully designed.

						    			Ecuador has reported one of the highest per capita death rates of COVID-19 in the world,  with  more  than  5000  deaths  in  a  country  of  approxi-mately 17 million people.  Transmission of COVID-19 infection in Ecuador has been the result of contact patterns, mobility structure of the population, regional epidemiology, and efficacy of public health interventions. In this study, we link provincial-level demographic,  epidemiological,  and  transportation  information with the spread of COVID-19 outbreak to understand the role of local patterns of low and high-density provinces on the infection growth rate at the country level. The analysis is carried out using best (with no interprovincial movement) and worst (with movement patterns similar to before COVID-19 outbreak) case scenarios in Ecuador. The results suggest that human movement (instead of local epidemiology) has primarily been shaping transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Ecuador by introducing infected individuals regularly into low-risk provinces.

						    			Epidemiological models have been employed with great success to explore the efficacy of alternative strategies at combating disease outbreaks. These models have often incorporated an understanding of age-based susceptibility and severity of outcome, considering how to limit the adverse outcomes or disease burden relative to an age structure. Such models frequently recommend the preferential treatment/vaccination of children or elderly, demonstrating how prevention of serious disease within these etiological subgroups can provide both protection within the subgroup itself and indirect protection to the broader population.
However, it is most frequently the case that these target populations are consumers, rather than providers, of household resources. In areas of the globe where continued health of household members relies on continued provision of resources, these models may fail to provide the most effective overall strategies for health outcomes in both target populations and overall. This is particularly important for tropical diseases impacting rural and low-income areas in which the disease may be endemic or newly emergent, particularly in the wake of natural disasters.
We propose a modified SIR model with targeted treatment in resource-limited populations. We evaluate the model over a broad parameter space. This model demonstrates how economic limitations may shift the optimal strategy. It may be advantageous to treat populations at lesser direct risk if they are responsible for providing secondary protection to higher-risk population(s) by producing household resources. Evaluation of this model over the parameter space reveals that, in some cases, targeting treatment towards consumers may result in greater numbers of consumer infections.
Our results demonstrate how household resource limitation can, in certain regions of the parameter space, drastically affect the impact of targeted treatment strategies for limiting epidemics. Depending on the economic circumstances, it is possible that focusing treatment on consumers such as children can produce a counter-intuitive outcome in which more children contract the disease.

						    			Laurel wilt is fatal fungal tree disease vectored by the invasive Redbay Ambrosia Beetle (RAB). Redbay trees and sassafrass trees are both susceptible to the fungal disease, and upon infection both provide suitable host material for RAB. Each of these two species responds differently to the fungal infection, with only redbay trees producing shoots that grow from the root system, called basal sprouts, and thus providing further potential host material for RAB. Using a stage structured SI model, we will explore the effect of basal sprout production on boom and bust disease cycles and the establishment of RAB. We interpret our results to provide insight on the circumstances which lead to Laurel wilt becoming endemic or local extinction of Sassafras and Redbay trees, which is vital for disease control.

						    			On 31st December 2019, China first reported WHO about a unknown disease and on 11th February 2020, WHO announced the name COVID-19. On 11th March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus) as a pandemic. It is the global health crisis in this time and is the biggest challenge we have faced since world war two. To curb the spread of COVID-19, most of the countries implemented lockdown but the pandemic is still growing significantly. Our aim is to show that lockdown is one factor only to reduce transmission of the diseases but one more important factor is treatment control. In this paper, we propose a SIRS model with a treatment function. In this model, we have determined the basic reproduction number R0, which is inversely proportional to the treatment capacity. We can control the outbreak of COVID-19 when the basic reproduction number is less than one. We will show that increasing the maximum capacity we can stop the disease. Example of China shows that treatment is playing a bigger role, China set up a special 1000 bed hospital in just 10 days. Lockdown and quarantine are not sufficient and increasing the capacity of treatment to maximum is suggested to decrease the infective population.

						    			Waiting times between two consecutive infection and recovery events in spreading processes are often assumed to be exponentially distributed, which results in Markovian (i.e., memoryless) continuous spreading dynamics. However, this is not taking into account memory (correlation) effects and discrete interactions that have been identified as relevant in social, transportation, and disease dynamics. We introduce a framework to model continuous, discrete, and hybrid forms of (non-)Markovian susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) stochastic processes on networks. The hybrid SIR processes that we study in this paper describe infections as discrete-time Markovian and recovery events as continuous-time non-Markovian processes, which mimic the distribution of cell cycles. Our results suggest that the effective-infection-rate description of epidemic processes fails to uniquely capture the behavior of such hybrid and also general non-Markovian disease dynamics. Providing a unifying description of general Markovian and non-Markovian disease outbreaks, we instead show that the mean transmissibility produces the same phase diagrams independent of the underlying inter-event-time distributions.

						    			Throughout the years, since 1981 approximately, the virus HIV marked its presence in the humanity razing with a large number of lives in which children, teenagers, and adults were involved. Although the rates of death caused by HIV have reduced notably because of antiretroviral drugs, the HIV continues spreading in the population.  Due to above, in this research HIV spreading is modelled, in special in the city of Pasto, Nariño in Colombia, where thanks to the review of data provided by the NDHI (Nariño departmental health institute)  was evident that in recent years, exactly between 2008 and 2018 the number of infected people increased. Then, this fact  lead the study of the dynamics of HIV transmission in Pasto, where is necessary a search for information of  strategies applied to control the infection, which give bases to propose a mathematical model which initially describes the dynamics of transmission of said epidemic and, finally, it will have a theoretical control incorporated based on sex education campaigns,  which pretends to maximize the number of protected people against HIV and clearly avoid the number of people with HIV increases.

						    			This research work is framed within the area of modelling hospital-acquired infections. I will introduce a number of existing compartmental-based approaches for modelling the spread of (typically antibiotic resistant) bacteria in hospital settings. Mathematical models with a relatively small number of compartments can be used for representing the spread of bacteria across patients and healthcare workers (HCWs), including relevant factors such as environmental contamination. However, more complex approaches (i.e., models with a large number of compartments, or network-based representations) are needed for example when introducing spatial considerations or HCW-patient contact network structures. When looking at network-based approaches, I will show some recent work on analysing exactly these epidemic dynamics on small networks. When considering an SIR epidemic process on a network, this analytic and computational approach amounts to the analysis of the exact 3^N-states continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), and makes special focus on algorithmic aspects and the organisation of the space of states S=(S,I,R)^N. Finally, I will present some recent results on the applicability of graph-automorphism lumping techniques in these systems.

						    			Reductions in human mobility have been a major strategy in controlling COVID-19 transmissions. However, analysis of publicly available data has revealed decreases in COVID-19 death rates that precede mobility changes. This suggests that, in some regions, there are mobility-independent factor(s) slowing COVID-19 deaths. Given the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 has had among nursing homes both in the US and in other countries, we hypothesized that this high-risk population might have dominated early changes in mortality rate. Simulations of a two-population SEIRD model, where one population is more vulnerable, reveal that early-phase decoupling may occur if susceptible individuals in the more vulnerable population are depleted before mobility changes can occur. More work is needed to determine whether mortality in nursing homes explains regional early-phase decoupling.

						    			ASICRD model —Susceptible, Infectious, Critically infectious, Removed and Dead was employed to model COVID-19. While the model is certainly very simple, it captures important early dynamics of diseases such as Covid-19. The model is calibrated for the deaths in the linear phase, which turns out to be a 2x2 linear system. The calibration can be done without any knowledge of the model parameters and allows for a universal fitting over the linear phase.As expected the fitted linear model has the first eigenvalue positive, while the second eigenvalue λ 2 is negative, but otherwise free. It turns out, however, that λ 2 ∈ B ⊂ (−∞,0), where B is a compact interval. For each choice of λ 2 we have a distinct value of0. For this model0(λ2) is monotonic in B. This allows for a bracketing of the possible values of 0. For all choices of the remaining free parameters, the linear dynamics is indistinguishable — though the nonlinear dynamics will be different. Another interesting point is that, once the fitting is done, the non-linear dynamics can be described by a one parameter family of sub-models. This allows for a convenient description of the epidemic evolution scenarios. (This is a joint work by Moacyr Silva, Helio Schechtman and Max O Souza)

The local and global stability of the system is presented as well. For local asymptotical stability, linearization, and Routh-Hurwitz criterion and show that if R_0<1, then the system is locally asymptotically stable otherwise unstable.

						    			Despite being one of the first countries to implement mass drug administration (MDA) for elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in 2001 after a pilot study in 2000, the Philippines is yet to eliminate the disease as a public health problem with 6 out of the 46 endemic provinces still implementing MDA for LF as of 2018. In this work, we propose a mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of LF and its elimination using MDA in the Philippines. Using the computed basic reproduction number R0, we show that the disease-free equilibrium E0 of the model system is locally asymptotically stable when R0 < 1 and unstable when R0 > 1, whereas the endemic equilibrium E* is locally asymptotically stable when R0 > 1. Sensitivity analysis using the Latin Hypercube Sampling and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient method suggests that the infected human population is most sensitive to the treatment parameters. Using the available LF data in Caraga Region from the Philippine Department of Health (DOH), we estimate the treatment rates r1, r2 using the least squares parameter estimation technique. Finally, we apply optimal control theory with the objective of minimizing the infected human population and the corresponding implementation cost of MDA, using the treatment coverage γ as the control parameter. Simulation results highlight the importance of maintaining a high MDA coverage per year to effectively minimize the infected population by the year 2030. This work is envisioned to be protocol-directing and policy-making. As there are still several endemic areas in the Philippines and other tropical countries in the Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regions, this study could help the DOH and other ministries of health in designing more effective implementation approaches for MDA to achieve LF elimination in the near future.

						    			Previous reports show that it is not uncommon for patients to have two viruses at the same time. At the current time, we do not know how to treat co-infections. In order to test the effects of having these concurrent infections, we simulate the two infections using a mathematical model. We use our model to simulate influenza A virus (IAV) coinfected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) coinfected with human rhinovirus (hRV). Using the model, we can estimate the co-duration of the viruses, the individual duration, and the peak virus amount for both viruses, both with and without drug treatment of the infections to figure out the best treatment strategies for co-infections. We find that sometimes treating one infection can lead to the lengthening of the other infection.

						    			The Generalized Linear Chain Trick (GLCT) is a conceptually and practically useful approach for deriving mean field ODE models, since it describes how the structure of mean-field ODE models (and quantities like the basic reproduction number) reflect the assumptions of an often unspecified underlying continuous-time, stochastic state-transition model. In this talk, I will first describe how to generalize an existing ODE model -- such as the SEIR model or Rosenzweig-MacArthur consumer-resource model -- using the GLCT to incorporate non-exponential dwell times (e.g., latent periods in SEIR models, or predator maturation times in consumer-resource models) that are Erlang distributed or, more generally, are phase-type distributed. The phase-type family of distributions are the absorption time distributions for continuous time Markov chains, and include exponential, Erlang, generalized Erlang, and Coxian distributions. Second, I will show how the structure of the resulting ODE model, which is of arbitrary finite dimension, can be exploited to obtain a general expression for the (basic) reproduction number. These results illustrate the utility of the GLCT, not just for model derivation, but also for model analysis and interpretation.

						    			Agents-based models (ABM) become more and more popular in applied mathematics. During last 15 years a large number of ABM have been created and used in different scientific area (ecology, economy, epidemiology, human behavior to name a few), but in this paper, only ABM for influenza epidemic/pandemic dynamics in cities are considered in detail. Based on a critical review of currently accepted ABM of such special type new ABM has been proposed. Unlike the old ABM, it can be used for analysis of efficiency and cost of all interventions (how for ones had been carried out before and during epidemic or pandemic under consideration and ones that could be implemented but had not been carried out for some reasons). Moreover, under some conditions, new ABM gives us an opportunity to analyze efficiency and cost of different interventions for future oncoming epidemics (first of all pandemics) and to select its optimal combination.

						    			Modeling with reaction-diffusion systems involves constituents locally transformed into each other by chemical reactions and transported in space by diffusion. With this in mind, the attention to mathematical and disease epidemiology has increased, as disease epidemics have become a predominant worldwide health issue. The case of Vibrio Cholerae (blue-death) is no different especially in a country like Ghana. Factors that affect the transmission of such a disease includes mainly both human and environmental factors. Proposing a Reaction-Diffusion SIR-B mathematical model for Cholera with proliferate stability analysis on the epidemic and endemic equilibrium, that incorporates an environmental reservoir is formulated to capture the movement of human hosts and host organisms in a heterogeneous environment. Findings here are supported by the results of numerical simulations and based on these results, an evolutionary process that involves organism distribution and their interaction of spatially distributed population with local diffusion is presented. Results show that the model dynamics exhibit a diffusion-controlled formation of patterns which attribute to diffusion having a great influence on the spread of the disease.

						    			Here we propose a mathematical model with a saturated treatment rate in the presence of information. We consider that the information about the disease affects the transmission rate of infection and hence the transmission rate is corrected. We also assume that people are losing their immunity against disease and the model is of SIRS type. We analyse the stability of the model system and our analysis shows that the model possesses the existence of backward bifurcation and multiple endemic steady states. Various situations of multiple endemic equilibrium points are explored numerically. Further, we extend the model to include the time lags in information and we found that in presence of time delay, the endemic steady state destabilizes and oscillations are observed. Thus, we conclude that if information dissemination is delayed beyond a threshold time then the infection oscillates in population and it may lead to difficulty in controlling the disease. Also, nonlinear incidence rate and saturated treatment may cause the existence of multiple endemic equilibrium and hence leads to complex dynamics.

						    			Households are known to be high-risk locations for the transmission of communicable diseases.   Numerous modelling studies have demonstrated the important role of households in sustaining both communicable diseases outbreaks and endemic transmission, and as the focus for control efforts.  However, these studies typically assume that households are associated with a single dwelling and have static membership. This assumption  does  not appropriately  reflect  households in some populations, such as those in remote Australian Indigenous communities, which can be distributed across more than one physical dwelling, leading to the occupancy of individual dwellings changing rapidly over time. In this study, we developed an individual-based model of an infectious disease outbreak in communities with demographic and household structure reflective of a remote Australian Indigenous community.   We used the model to compare the dynamics of unmitigated outbreaks, and outbreaks constrained by a household-focused prophylaxis intervention, in communities exhibiting fluid versus stable dwelling occupancy.   Our findings suggest that fluid dwelling occupancy can lead to larger and faster outbreaks, interfere with the effectiveness of household-focused interventions, and may contribute to the considerable burden of communicable diseases in communities exhibiting this type of structure.

						    			This work aims to study the dynamical behavior of a dengue epidemics model by introducing biological control. The first model represents the SEIR-SEI model of dengue epidemics and the second model corresponds to coupling a model of biological control. Controlling mosquitoes is considered by an infestation of bacteria that inhibit the transmission of dengue in humans. We determine an analytic expression of replacement ratios that depends on biological control. The results obtained show that the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is determined by the value of a certain threshold parameter called the basic reproductive number R0 and of the replacement ratios of the biological model RU, RW. The sensitivity analysis shows that the vector to human transmission rate promotes more changes to the biological control system than other parameters. The simulation analysis of the last model showed the efficiency of the biologic control of dengue transmission.

						    			Protein aggregation poses major health challenges for humans, but instead confer beneficial phenotypes for yeast. However, experiments on yeast systems necessarily involve multiple scales cell/colony. In this talk, I describe efforts towards linking these scales with mathematical models.
More specifically, propagon counting assays reflect the intracellular amplification process of prion aggregation coupled with cell-division. We model these experiments with generation and aggregate structured population models. Through an inverse problem formulation we attempt to infer the intracellular replication rates of these aggregates.

						    			Understanding the interplay of different traits in a co-infection system with multiple strains has many applications in ecology and epidemiology. Because of high dimensionality and complex feedbacks between traits, manifested in infection and co-infection, the study of such systems remains a challenge.  In the case where the strains are similar (quasi-neutrality assumption), we can model trait variation as perturbations in parameters, which simplifies analysis. Applying perturbation to many parameters at the same time is mathematically not easy. In this study, we advance in this direction. We consider and study such a quasi-neutral model of susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) type with N strains and variation in transmission, clearance, and co-colonization traits. The slow-fast dynamics and the Tikhonov's theorem are essential approaches that we use to analyze the system, under the perspective of the replicator equation, where the variables are frequencies of N strains. Coefficients of this replicator system, that inherently are pairwise invasion fitnesses of strains, characterize not only pairwise outcomes but also determine collective behavior. We illustrate the model framework by investigating particularly dynamics with two strains (N=2), and explicitly analyzing different fitness dimensions and their interplay for maintenance and stabilization of diversity.

						    			Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects around 200 million people worldwide. It is a macroparasite infection, caused by trematode from genus Schistosoma, whose intermediate host is a snail from genus Biomphalaria that is caracteristic of places with fresh water. Moreover, it is estimated that, every year, 100 thousand individuals die due to schistosomiasis-related causes. In Brazil, schistosomiasis is endemic in 13 states and affects around 25 million people that live in risk areas, with 6 million infected individuals (estimated).
Its biological cycle is very complex, having five different life stages: egg, miracidium, sporocyst, cercaria and schistosomula, which makes its control even more difficult. The recomended diagnostic method, named Kato-Katz, seeks for eggs in the individual's feces and does not have a high sensitivity. In 2007, a group of researchers developed a new method, named Helmintex, that uses paramagnetic markers to find the eggs in feces and showed to be three times more sensitive than Kato-Katz.
We sought to investigate the effects on the schistosomiasis dynamics of applying a mass diagnostic strategy, the idea is that infected individuals, who are diagnosed, are treated. In order to do that, we build an ordinary differential equations model that considers: a human population divided in susceptible individuals and three classes of infected people that represent different levels of worm burden; a snail population, susceptible and infected, and a miracidium reservoir, that is important in order to take in to account the reinfection effects of the highest level of worm burden. The cercaria dynamics is implicitly considered through the human infection parameters.
We performed the equilibrium and local stability analysis for different scenarios in order to compare the results. (i) First, considering that a more sensitive diagnostic method, the Helmitex, is applyed, setting to zero the human population in the two highest levels of worm burden; (ii) considering that a less sensitive method, the Kato-Katz, is applyed, setting to zero only the highest level of worm burden; and the last case, (iii) the complete model that represents the scenario in which there is no treatment/diagnostic strategy.
Our results, besides the conditions for existence and local stability of the endemic equilibrium points, suggest that the low sensitivity of the classic method can explain the why it is so difficult to control the infections and why, usually, after stop the treatment on a population, or precaution strategies, the infection prevalences returns to a high level.

						    			In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease a pandemic. We used a mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in a mid-sized city. Interventions reduced contacts of adults >60 years of age, adults 20–59 years of age, and children <19 years of age for 6 weeks. Our results suggest interventions started earlier in the epidemic delay the epidemic curve and interventions started later flatten the epidemic curve. We noted that, while social distancing interventions were in place, most new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were averted, even with modest reductions in contact among adults. However, when interventions ended, the epidemic rebounded. Our models suggest that social distancing can provide crucial time to increase healthcare capacity but must occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate virus transmission.
