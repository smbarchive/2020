Enderling@moffitt. org. 									1. Where will eSMB2020 take place?: 	  	   				The eSMB2020 conference will be held virtually. Through partnership with MathDept. org, we will utilize Sococo, Zoom, and Slack to create an immersive conference experience. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  2. What are the registration costs?: 	  	   				The registration fee is $25 for our first virtual annual meeting. You must register for the meeting through the registration website. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  3. Do I need to register if I am not presenting a poster or abstract?: 	  	   				Yes, registration is required for participation in eSMB2020. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									4. What the poster requirements?: 	  	   				Registration is required to present a poster. Please register at your earliest convenience at smb2020. org/registration.  A tutorial video of the sococo platform is online for you to get a glimpse into what the virtual poster session will look and feel like ( http://smb2020. org/logistics/ ). Please follow the following guidelines: 													Poster dimensions: Max of 3' x 4/ (91cm x 122cm). 					Format: PDF only					File Size: Not to exceed 25MB. 					If necessary, here are instructions to reduce file size: https://www. wikihow. com/Reduce-PDF-File-Size. 					Please save your poster with the following File Name: Lastname_Firstname_XXXX. pdf, where XXXX is to be replaced by the identifier of the SMB subgroup the poster belongs to. XXXX = { CDEV, EDUC, IMMU, MEPI, NEUR, ONCO, MFBM, POPD, OTHE }. All subgroups (and corresponding codes) are listed on the subgroup page. 					Please upload your poster pdf to the Subgroup Google Drive folder that your subgroup chair emailed you. 															   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;																															  	  5. If I submitted my abstract to the Heidelberg ESMTB meeting, is it too late to transfer it to SMB2020?: 	  	   				If you have not yet transferred your abstract, please submit your abstract as a new abstract during eSMB2020 registration.  	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  6. Will the Heidelberg ESMTB meeting still take place?: 	  	   				ESMTB organizers plan to hold ESMTB in 2021 in Heidelberg. Unfortunately, this won’t be a joint meeting with the SMB. The SMB 2021 annual meeting will be held at UC Riverside. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  7. Will my talk be recorded or live-streamed?: 	  	   				The eSMB2020 conference offers the unprecedented opportunity to record talks for dissemination after the meeting. Live-streaming is currently not planned. During abstract submission, authors can select to opt in/out of recordings.  	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  8. Can I re-submit an updated abstract?: 	  	   				Yes. To submit an updated abstract, please coordinate with the SMB subgroup lead that your abstract belongs to. If your abstract does not belong to an SMB subgroup, please contact Torbjörn Lundh. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  9. Can I submit an abstract that is not affiliated with any subgroup?: 	  	   				Yes, during abstract submission you choose the option ‘none of the above’ for subgroup affiliation. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  10. Can we still organize minisymposia?: 	  	   				Please reach out to the SMB subgroup leaders that your minisymposium thematically belongs to to confirm if accommodations can be made for additional minisymopisia. Note: the mathematical oncology section is currently at capacity and cannot accept further MS submissions. Otherwise, if the MS thematically does not belong to a subgroup, please contact Torbjörn Lundh. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  11. When will I be notified about abstract selection?: 	  	   				All submitted abstract will be evaluated by the SMB Subgroups and conference scientific committee after the abstract submission deadline on July 15. Notification of abstract selection for poster or oral presentation will be sent before the end of July.  	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  12. I've completed the registration form, but did not submit an abstract yet. How do I submit my abstract post-registration?: 	  	   				You can send your title and abstract to the SMB Membership Team at membership@smb. org, and they will add it to your registration. 	   	  	  	  13. How do I format my virtual poster?: 	  	   				Posters should be landscape format and saved as a single page pdf, to ensure that everybody will be able to view it on their personal computer or tablet.

However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.     	  			&lt;/br&gt;									    	  Conference Schedule: 	        	    * all times are listed in US Eastern Time Zone.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

However, the drugs we typically use to treat these diseases target a single protein (e. g. anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for treating diabetic retinopathy) and disregard the fact that cells within tissues are highly heterogeneous and have individualized responses that contribute to the tissue-level outcomes. To bridge the gap between protein and multi-cell/tissue-levels, my lab develops agent-based computational models and uses them in combination with experimental approaches, to predict how individual cell behaviors give rise to tissue-level adaptations. We have used agent-based modeling to simulate the structural adaptations of large and small blood vessels, skeletal muscle regeneration following injury, and immune cell trafficking and differentiation during inflammation and infection. Our studies have suggested new mechanistic hypotheses and provided suggestions for the design of novel therapies that account for the dynamic and heterogeneous interactions between different cell types within a diseased tissue.

Trophic (consumer-resource) interactions, which comprise the fundamental units (modules) of food webs, are of particular importance because they have an intrinsic tendency to fluctuate in abundance, thus running to risk of stochastic extinction during periods of low abundances. Here I present a mathematical framework for predicting warming effects on consumer-resource interactions.  This work differs from previous theory in two important ways. First, it uses delay differential equations to realistically depict the developmental delays inherent in ectotherm life cycles, and incorporates mechanistic descriptions of phenotypic trait responses, derived from first principles of thermodynamics, into the dynamical delay model. Second, it investigates the recent IPCC predictions on the increase in the number of hotter-than-average days. I report three key results. First, across latitudes (tropical vs. temperate) and feeding strategies (juvenile vs. adult attacked), a greater increase in the maximum temperature compared to the minimum (hotter-than-average summers) is more detrimental to consumer-resource interactions than a greater increase in the minimum temperature (warmer-than-average winters).  Second, across latitude and warming scenarios, effects of warming are more detrimental when the consumer attacks the adult stage of the resource.  Third, across warming scenarios and feeding strategies, consumer-resource interactions in the tropics are more at risk of species losses due to warming while those in the temperate zone are more at risk of extreme fluctuations in species' abundances. I discuss implications of these results for biodiversity and biological pest control. 				     			    			   		    		    		  									{% include happy_hour. html %}						&lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									 				 {% include schedule_menu. html %}			 																				      	      		      														Click to show abstracts											      	            "

Cell and developmental biology has long proven a fertile ground for mathematical modelling and, with recent advances in microscopy, image analysis, and fluorescent reporter methods, it is becoming an increasingly quantitative discipline. We are now able to constrain mathematical models of developmental processes, for example through parameter estimation, increasing the potential of such models to be used in a predictive way. The objective of this Subgroup is to accelerate these efforts, by supporting and advancing the use of mathematical modelling as part of the ‘toolkit’ of cell and developmental biology.

In applying standard methodologies, mathematical modelers encounter many challenges with simulating and analyzing biological systems, such as high dimensionality, computational complexity, observation or process error, model bias, and intra- and inter-individual heterogeneity. The objective of the Subgroup is to support and disseminate new advances in tackling these challenges to the Mathematical Biology community.

In the brain, levels of acetylcholine change with activity. For example, acetylcholine is higher during waking and REM sleep and low during slow wave sleep.  In this talk we show how the M-current affects the bifurcation structure of a generic conductance-based neural model and how this determines synchronization properties of the model. We then use phase-model analysis to study the effect of a slowly varying M-current on synchronization. This is joint work with Victoria Booth, Xueying Wang and Isam Al-Darbasah.

The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this novel coronavirus.  Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5 infected patients hospitalized with severe disease.  Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0. 7 to 9 ng/mL.  Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are quite immunogenic.  In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike.  Cyro-electron microscopy structures of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two RBDs revealed recognition of the closed, “all RBD-down” conformation of the spike.  Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.

Apical constriction is a ubiquitous cell shape change of epithelial tissues that promotes epithelia folding and cell/tissue invagination in a variety of contexts.  Apical constriction promotes tissue bending by changing the shape of constituent cells from a columnar-shape to a wedge-shape.  Drosophila gastrulation is one of the classic examples of apical constriction, where cells constrict to fold the primitive epithelial sheet and internalize cells that will give rise to internal organs. We have used a combination of imaging, experimental perturbation, and modeling, to determine how actomyosin organization promotes tissue folding.  The actin cytoskeleton is organized in both time and space to facilitate apical constriction.  We found that actomyosin contraction is pulsatile and requires dynamic regulation of upstream signaling processes. In addition, we found that actomyosin becomes organized into oriented fibers, which generates anisotropic tension that is critical for tissue shape.  Furthermore, connectivity within the network of actomyosin fibers is highly redundant, promoting the robustness of folding.

Most people think they have pretty good bullshit detectors, at least when it comes to advertising hyperbole, weasel words, and politicians’ promises. Quantitative claims are harder: Numbers have the sense of objectivity and precision, and people feel less confident in challenging them. Yet with COVID-19, quantitative epidemiology is on the front page of every newspaper on every day of the week. Shortly before the pandemic broke out, I finished a book on how to spot and refute quantitative misinformation. Every lesson in the book has proven useful during the current pandemic. In this talk, I will present a tour of how misleading numbers, statistics, mathematics, and data graphics have muddied the social and traditional media streams that we all rely upon during COVID. I will give examples of deliberate disinformation, and examples of unintended misinformation around the pandemic. And I will explore how as citizens and as educators we all can promote data reasoning and quantitative literacy. 				     			    			   		    		    		    		  									&lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									 				 {% include schedule_menu. html %}			 																	      		      									Click to show abstracts						            "

In a tumor, neighboring subclonal cancer cell populations interact both through competition for resources and through cooperation, by the production of growth promoting signals. Promoting competition can maintain drug sensitivity when resistant cells get outcompeted. Cooperation can promote cell survival under selective pressure, as well as potentially protect cellular populations that may otherwise be susceptible to treatment. Our research program integrates three key components to quantify cancer cell interactions: serial patient tumor samples molecularly profiled at the single cell level, a parallel in vitro model system where mechanisms can be tested through experimental manipulation and measured over time, and integrative dynamic mathematical models of the growth and interaction of subclonal cancer populations. By embedding the time course data and differential equation models into a Bayesian inference framework, we can estimate the strength of positive and negative interactions between subclonal populations during treatment and identify key mechanisms driving cell communication. Our analyses of patient derived samples further indicates that heterogeneous multi-clonal ER+ breast cell populations evolve to acquire alternative signaling states that drive cell cycle progression independent of estrogen availability, and that cells can cooperate to survive during therapy through the increased production and local sharing of growth promoting factors. 					    				     			    			   		    		    		  									{% include happy_hour. html %}						&lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									 				 {% include schedule_menu. html %}			 											      		      									Click to show abstracts						            "

Many are confused, rely on less than reliable sources for information, and reject scientific authorities equating the evolution of knowledge to lack of expertise. Given the current situation: what is our role and responsibility as educators to help our students be more informed, critical thinkers? How must we empower them through education to identify reliable sources and to better understand the scientific process? In this talk, we will reflect on ways in which we can respond to the current knowledge deficit, and why it is our duty to do so.

Chemotaxis is important to many of the things cells do in vivo, particularly during development and disease. It is also a favourite topic for mathematical biologists. However, despite decades of studies of how cells can interpret chemotactic gradients, there has been very little attention to how gradients form, and where the information comes from. We have studied a particularly interesting aspect of this problem - self-generated gradients, in which cells form their own gradients at the same time as interpreting them and migrating up them. Self-generated gradients are fascinating, and ideal for mathematical biologists - they are so dynamic that they are nearly impossible to measure, and they incorporate multiple levels of feedback. I will describe how we use modelling, mathematics and experiments on Dictyostelium and cancer cells to understand different self-generated gradients. In particular I will show how cells can solve arbitrarily complex mazes, escape from tumours, and use the information in a gradient to move down-gradient as well as up-gradient. 					    				     			    			   		    		    		  									{% include happy_hour. html %}						&lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									 				 {% include schedule_menu. html %}			 											      		      									Click to show abstracts						            "

However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.     	  			&lt;/br&gt;									    	  Conference Schedule: 	        	    * all times are listed in US Eastern Time Zone.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.     	  			&lt;/br&gt;									    	  Conference Schedule: 	        	    * all times are listed in US Eastern Time Zone.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.     	  			&lt;/br&gt;									    	  Conference Schedule: 	        	    * all times are listed in US Eastern Time Zone.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.     	  			&lt;/br&gt;									    	  Conference Schedule: 	        	    * all times are listed in US Eastern Time Zone.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

    "body": "2020/06/08 - Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. We will probably remember these days, in years to come, as a true opportunity to contribute to the global fight against the pandemic. Predictive mathematical models that capture the underlying mechanistic biology of specific processes are at the heart of everything we do. The COVID-19 virus pandemic has brought into sharp focus the critical importance of mathematical models in both making predictions about current trends in the disease dynamics but also how specific interventions, such as social distancing, might modify them. Understanding these interventions theoretically becomes important not only for mathematical biologists, but also for politicians and other decision makers. Most of the our society members are currently doing some form of social distancing, as is a large proportion of the world. In these confined and difficult times, anxiety and stress are running high. But it is important to remember that we have the power of mathematical modelling behind us. Their predictive ability illustrates why we must slowdown the spread of this virus by staying home. Flattening the curve has become our new mantra. Importantly mathematical modelling will also help us decide how to best end this quarantine. We are at a key point in the history of our society where our models are helping to inform policy decisions that impact millions of lives. Therefore it is fundamental that we make every effort to articulate as clearly as possible what mathematical models are, what they can be used for, and what are their limitations. The integration of mathematics and biology may sound strange at first to the public. But if you find yourself in a situation where you need to explain why certain decisions are being made, please take the time to do so. Articulate the role of predictive mathematical models, but not as something magical, even though they might seem so at times. Rather that they are based on our understanding of the physical and biological processes that underly the spread of this disease. We are a diverse group of scientists and educators who work at the interface of many disciplines not just epidemiology. Our society does have a dedicated subgroup in Mathematical Epidemiology and I encourage you join them if you are interested in this area of research or if you want to learn more. We also have 7 other subgroups covering everything from development to oncology and more - I’m extremely proud of our research diversity. The purpose of this email was to shine a little light and say thank you, to celebrate the wonderful discipline we are part of and highlight the important role mathematical models are playing right now. We are fortunate in many ways, with our ability to more readily work from home than most disciplines. We can make predictions about disease dynamics without ever actually treating a patient or being forced to make difficult decisions in medical care. We can run thousands of realisations of an experiment in a fraction of the time it would take in real life. We can make rigorously constrained predictions about the spread of an epidemic and how to slow it down. Ultimately the countermeasures needed to control and end this pandemic will rely on biomedical research on drugs and vaccines. But again, their impact can and should be studied through the lens of mathematical modelling. I would be remiss if I didn’t give a special thanks to our colleagues, friends and family members in the medical profession. Without their frontline action flattening the curve becomes meaningless. Stay safe, stay home and celebrate mathematical biology! -Sandy Anderson, SMB President "

		    			Mechanical cell competition is important during tissue development, cancer invasion, and tissue ageing. To study this phenomenon, we propose a one-dimensional mechanical model of cell migration in heterogeneous epithelial tissues that includes cell-length-dependent proliferation and death mechanisms. Proliferation and death are modelled in the discrete model stochastically and arise as source/sink terms in the corresponding continuum model that we derive. Applications we discuss include the evolution of homogeneous tissues experiencing proliferation and death, and cancer invasion with a cancerous tissue competing for space with an adjacent normal tissue. This framework allows us to postulate new mecha- nisms that explain the ability of cancer cells to outcompete healthy cells through mechanical differences rather than by having some intrinsic proliferative advantage.

		    			A major challenge in malignant tumours is cell heterogeneity, which has been proposed to arise due to temporal variations in nutrient supply caused by highly irregular vasculature. Such variability requires cells to adapt to potentially lethal variations in environmental conditions. Risk spreading (“bet-hedging”) through spontaneous phenotypic variations is an evolutionary strategy that allows species to survive in temporally varying environments. Individuals within a species diversify their phenotypes ensuring that at least some of them can survive in the face of sudden environmental change. We aim to investigate whether cancer cells may adopt this strategy when dealing with rapidly changing levels of nutrient due to temporally-varying blood flow. Here, we present a system of nonlocal partial differential equations modelling the evolutionary dynamics of phenotype-structured cancer cell populations exposed to fluctuating oxygen levels. In this model, the phenotypic state of every cell is described by a continuous variable that provides a simple representation of its metabolic phenotype, ranging from fully oxidative to fully glycolytic. The cells are grouped into two competing populations that undergo heritable, spontaneous, phenotypic variations at different rates. A combination of analysis and numerical simulations indicates that under certain conditions the cell-oxygen dynamics can lead to regions of chronic hypoxia (low oxygen level) and cycling hypoxia. Moreover, the model shows that under chronic-hypoxic conditions lower rates of phenotypic variation lead to a competitive advantage, whereas higher rates of phenotypic variation can confer a competitive advantage under cycling-hypoxic conditions. In the latter case, bet-hedging evolutionary strategies, whereby cells switch between oxidative and glycolytic phenotypes, can spontaneously emerge. These results shed light on the evolutionary processes that may underpin the emergence of phenotypic heterogeneity in vascularised tumours, and suggest potential therapeutic strategies.

		    			Serrated sessile polyps (SSPs) are a type of lesion found in the colon that are known to lead to colorectal cancer. They develop when there are disruptions in the processes controlling the function of colonic crypts - the test-tube shaped structures that make up the lining of colon. It is currently not clear what will cause a healthy crypt to become serrated. The crypt has been extensively modelled, owing to its relatively simple composition. However, little modelling work has focused on the formation of serrated crypts, perhaps because of the relatively difficult task of modelling the epithelial monolayer on a deformable supporting structure. In this talk, we will introduce new a modelling approach that allows us to build a deformable membrane, sidestepping the issues that made the predominant off lattice models less suitable. We will then present some preliminary findings on the potential causes behind the characteristic appearance of serrated crypts elucidated by this model.

		    			Introduction: The search for combination therapies against cancer has focused on studying synergistic combinations (drug combinations with greater-than-additive efficacy) because they exhibit enhanced therapeutic efficacy at lower doses. Although synergistic combinations are intuitively attractive, therapeutic success often depends on whether drug resistance develops.  In computational modeling of drug-resistance evolution, our recent work (Saputra et. al, Cancer Res, 2018) delineated conditions under which synergistic pairs of drugs would have worse long-term performance than non-synergistic pairs of drugs, due to faster evolution of drug-resistance. In this work, we extend our modeling to three-drug combinations. In a multi-drug cocktail, some pairs of drugs may be synergistic while other pairs of drugs in the same cocktail may be additive or antagonistic (quantified using the combination index). Does this matter for evolution of drug-resistance? We develop theoretical generalizations about relative performance, for winning the race between cancer-killing efficacy versus drug-resistance evolution, using multi-drug cocktails with equal efficacy but different distributions of combination index (CI). Methods: We performed mathematical modeling of tumor cells evolving under selective pressure from synergistic, additive, and antagonistic three-drug combinations. Starting with small populations of drug-sensitive cells, we allowed rare mutational events to change a cell’s phenotype toward any single drug, which over time created potential for the presence or absence of drug-resistance against any or all drugs in the multi-drug therapy. Meanwhile, proliferation and death were simulated according to the combined cocktail efficacy toward each phenotype of cell. Results and Discussion: Longer duration of cancer control was achieved by multi-drug combinations having higher uniformity of pairwise CI (i.e., all pairs of drugs within the cocktail having similar levels of synergism, or all pairs having similar levels of antagonism), compared with multi-drug cocktails having equal initial efficacy and equal overall CI, but greater differences in the pairwise CI’s. In other words, treatment was more likely to fail sooner if the three drugs had non-uniform amounts of pairwise synergism, compared with cocktails that had more uniform CI between the drug-pairs within the cocktail. The difference in outcomes was due to partially resistant phenotypes that achieved greater competitive advantage (meaning greater clonal expansion and greater sabotage of therapy) by resisting the most synergistic aspects of the cocktail.  This is because resisting one part of a synergistic group destroys not on

	    		<article class="article-post text-justify" style="font-size:12px;">
		    		
		    			Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain cancer with a short median survival time. GBM is characterized by the hallmarks of aggressive proliferation and cellular infiltration of normal brain tissue. Tumor cells also interact with many cells including astrocytes and immune cells, and extracellular matrix (ECM) in a tumor microenvironment (TME) via exchanging molecular signals in order to increase survival rates in response to biochemical and biomechanical challenges. miRNAs and their downstream molecules are known to play a pivotal role in regulation of the balance of proliferation and aggressive invasion in response to metabolic stress in the tumour microenvironment (TME). Surgery-induced transition in reactive astrocyte populations can dramatically change the growth and invasion dynamics of GBM cells. In this work, we develop a multi-scale mathematical model of the tumor astrocytes dynamics in response to surgical resection of the primary tumor in TME. The hybrid model takes into account miR-451-LKB1-AMPK-OCT1-mTOR pathway signalling (ODEs), individual cell dynamics of the tumour, reactive astrocytes, stem cell-like astrocytes (lattice-free individual model), and signal transport by diffusible molecules (PDEs). We show how the effects of fluctuating glucose on tumour cell dynamics need to be reprogrammed by taking into account the recent history of glucose variations and an LKB1/OCT1 reciprocal feedback loop, which then determines tumor cell proliferation and migration. The model shows that surgery-induced changes in TME are the important factors for inducing the critical transition from reactive astrocytes to stem cell-like phenotypes. The model illustrates how variations in glucose availability significantly affect the activity of signalling molecules and, in turn, lead to critical cell migration. The model also predicts that (i) microsurgery of a primary tumour induces phenotypical changes in reactive astrocytes and stem cell-like astrocytes promoting tumour cell proliferation and migration by Cxcl5, (ii) this critical transition essentially increases the recurrence potential of GBM and leads to the low survival rate of patients. Finally, we investigated a new anti-tumour strategy by Cxcl5-targeting drugs in order to prevent this critical recurrence of the tumor.
