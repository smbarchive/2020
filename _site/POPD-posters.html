Enderling@moffitt. org. 									1. Where will eSMB2020 take place?: 	  	   				The eSMB2020 conference will be held virtually. Through partnership with MathDept. org, we will utilize Sococo, Zoom, and Slack to create an immersive conference experience. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  2. What are the registration costs?: 	  	   				The registration fee is $25 for our first virtual annual meeting. You must register for the meeting through the registration website. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  3. Do I need to register if I am not presenting a poster or abstract?: 	  	   				Yes, registration is required for participation in eSMB2020. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									4. What the poster requirements?: 	  	   				Registration is required to present a poster. Please register at your earliest convenience at smb2020. org/registration.  A tutorial video of the sococo platform is online for you to get a glimpse into what the virtual poster session will look and feel like ( http://smb2020. org/logistics/ ). Please follow the following guidelines: 													Poster dimensions: Max of 3' x 4/ (91cm x 122cm). 					Format: PDF only					File Size: Not to exceed 25MB. 					If necessary, here are instructions to reduce file size: https://www. wikihow. com/Reduce-PDF-File-Size. 					Please save your poster with the following File Name: Lastname_Firstname_XXXX. pdf, where XXXX is to be replaced by the identifier of the SMB subgroup the poster belongs to. XXXX = { CDEV, EDUC, IMMU, MEPI, NEUR, ONCO, MFBM, POPD, OTHE }. All subgroups (and corresponding codes) are listed on the subgroup page. 					Please upload your poster pdf to the Subgroup Google Drive folder that your subgroup chair emailed you. 															   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;																															  	  5. If I submitted my abstract to the Heidelberg ESMTB meeting, is it too late to transfer it to SMB2020?: 	  	   				If you have not yet transferred your abstract, please submit your abstract as a new abstract during eSMB2020 registration.  	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  6. Will the Heidelberg ESMTB meeting still take place?: 	  	   				ESMTB organizers plan to hold ESMTB in 2021 in Heidelberg. Unfortunately, this won’t be a joint meeting with the SMB. The SMB 2021 annual meeting will be held at UC Riverside. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  7. Will my talk be recorded or live-streamed?: 	  	   				The eSMB2020 conference offers the unprecedented opportunity to record talks for dissemination after the meeting. Live-streaming is currently not planned. During abstract submission, authors can select to opt in/out of recordings.  	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  8. Can I re-submit an updated abstract?: 	  	   				Yes. To submit an updated abstract, please coordinate with the SMB subgroup lead that your abstract belongs to. If your abstract does not belong to an SMB subgroup, please contact Torbjörn Lundh. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  9. Can I submit an abstract that is not affiliated with any subgroup?: 	  	   				Yes, during abstract submission you choose the option ‘none of the above’ for subgroup affiliation. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  10. Can we still organize minisymposia?: 	  	   				Please reach out to the SMB subgroup leaders that your minisymposium thematically belongs to to confirm if accommodations can be made for additional minisymopisia. Note: the mathematical oncology section is currently at capacity and cannot accept further MS submissions. Otherwise, if the MS thematically does not belong to a subgroup, please contact Torbjörn Lundh. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  11. When will I be notified about abstract selection?: 	  	   				All submitted abstract will be evaluated by the SMB Subgroups and conference scientific committee after the abstract submission deadline on July 15. Notification of abstract selection for poster or oral presentation will be sent before the end of July.  	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  12. I've completed the registration form, but did not submit an abstract yet. How do I submit my abstract post-registration?: 	  	   				You can send your title and abstract to the SMB Membership Team at membership@smb. org, and they will add it to your registration. 	   	  	  	  13. How do I format my virtual poster?: 	  	   				Posters should be landscape format and saved as a single page pdf, to ensure that everybody will be able to view it on their personal computer or tablet.  When designing your poster, please chose content and font size carefully to clearly communicate your research. All accepted posters will be uploaded to a shared drive for access through Sococo during the poster session. Details will be communicated in the next couple of weeks. 	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  			"

However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.     	  			&lt;/br&gt;									    	  Conference Schedule: 	        	    * all times are listed in US Eastern Time Zone.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

However, the drugs we typically use to treat these diseases target a single protein (e. g. anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for treating diabetic retinopathy) and disregard the fact that cells within tissues are highly heterogeneous and have individualized responses that contribute to the tissue-level outcomes. To bridge the gap between protein and multi-cell/tissue-levels, my lab develops agent-based computational models and uses them in combination with experimental approaches, to predict how individual cell behaviors give rise to tissue-level adaptations. We have used agent-based modeling to simulate the structural adaptations of large and small blood vessels, skeletal muscle regeneration following injury, and immune cell trafficking and differentiation during inflammation and infection. Our studies have suggested new mechanistic hypotheses and provided suggestions for the design of novel therapies that account for the dynamic and heterogeneous interactions between different cell types within a diseased tissue.

Trophic (consumer-resource) interactions, which comprise the fundamental units (modules) of food webs, are of particular importance because they have an intrinsic tendency to fluctuate in abundance, thus running to risk of stochastic extinction during periods of low abundances. Here I present a mathematical framework for predicting warming effects on consumer-resource interactions.  This work differs from previous theory in two important ways. First, it uses delay differential equations to realistically depict the developmental delays inherent in ectotherm life cycles, and incorporates mechanistic descriptions of phenotypic trait responses, derived from first principles of thermodynamics, into the dynamical delay model. Second, it investigates the recent IPCC predictions on the increase in the number of hotter-than-average days. I report three key results. First, across latitudes (tropical vs. temperate) and feeding strategies (juvenile vs. adult attacked), a greater increase in the maximum temperature compared to the minimum (hotter-than-average summers) is more detrimental to consumer-resource interactions than a greater increase in the minimum temperature (warmer-than-average winters).  Second, across latitude and warming scenarios, effects of warming are more detrimental when the consumer attacks the adult stage of the resource.  Third, across warming scenarios and feeding strategies, consumer-resource interactions in the tropics are more at risk of species losses due to warming while those in the temperate zone are more at risk of extreme fluctuations in species' abundances. I discuss implications of these results for biodiversity and biological pest control. 				     			    			   		    		    		  									{% include happy_hour. html %}						&lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									 				 {% include schedule_menu. html %}			 																				      	      		      														Click to show abstracts											      	            "

Cell and developmental biology has long proven a fertile ground for mathematical modelling and, with recent advances in microscopy, image analysis, and fluorescent reporter methods, it is becoming an increasingly quantitative discipline. We are now able to constrain mathematical models of developmental processes, for example through parameter estimation, increasing the potential of such models to be used in a predictive way. The objective of this Subgroup is to accelerate these efforts, by supporting and advancing the use of mathematical modelling as part of the ‘toolkit’ of cell and developmental biology.

In the brain, levels of acetylcholine change with activity. For example, acetylcholine is higher during waking and REM sleep and low during slow wave sleep.  In this talk we show how the M-current affects the bifurcation structure of a generic conductance-based neural model and how this determines synchronization properties of the model. We then use phase-model analysis to study the effect of a slowly varying M-current on synchronization. This is joint work with Victoria Booth, Xueying Wang and Isam Al-Darbasah.

The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this novel coronavirus.  Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5 infected patients hospitalized with severe disease.  Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0. 7 to 9 ng/mL.  Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are quite immunogenic.  In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike.  Cyro-electron microscopy structures of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two RBDs revealed recognition of the closed, “all RBD-down” conformation of the spike.  Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.

Apical constriction is a ubiquitous cell shape change of epithelial tissues that promotes epithelia folding and cell/tissue invagination in a variety of contexts.  Apical constriction promotes tissue bending by changing the shape of constituent cells from a columnar-shape to a wedge-shape.  Drosophila gastrulation is one of the classic examples of apical constriction, where cells constrict to fold the primitive epithelial sheet and internalize cells that will give rise to internal organs. We have used a combination of imaging, experimental perturbation, and modeling, to determine how actomyosin organization promotes tissue folding.  The actin cytoskeleton is organized in both time and space to facilitate apical constriction.  We found that actomyosin contraction is pulsatile and requires dynamic regulation of upstream signaling processes. In addition, we found that actomyosin becomes organized into oriented fibers, which generates anisotropic tension that is critical for tissue shape.  Furthermore, connectivity within the network of actomyosin fibers is highly redundant, promoting the robustness of folding.

Most people think they have pretty good bullshit detectors, at least when it comes to advertising hyperbole, weasel words, and politicians’ promises. Quantitative claims are harder: Numbers have the sense of objectivity and precision, and people feel less confident in challenging them. Yet with COVID-19, quantitative epidemiology is on the front page of every newspaper on every day of the week. Shortly before the pandemic broke out, I finished a book on how to spot and refute quantitative misinformation. Every lesson in the book has proven useful during the current pandemic. In this talk, I will present a tour of how misleading numbers, statistics, mathematics, and data graphics have muddied the social and traditional media streams that we all rely upon during COVID. I will give examples of deliberate disinformation, and examples of unintended misinformation around the pandemic. And I will explore how as citizens and as educators we all can promote data reasoning and quantitative literacy. 				     			    			   		    		    		    		  									&lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									 				 {% include schedule_menu. html %}			 																	      		      									Click to show abstracts						            "

In a tumor, neighboring subclonal cancer cell populations interact both through competition for resources and through cooperation, by the production of growth promoting signals. Promoting competition can maintain drug sensitivity when resistant cells get outcompeted. Cooperation can promote cell survival under selective pressure, as well as potentially protect cellular populations that may otherwise be susceptible to treatment. Our research program integrates three key components to quantify cancer cell interactions: serial patient tumor samples molecularly profiled at the single cell level, a parallel in vitro model system where mechanisms can be tested through experimental manipulation and measured over time, and integrative dynamic mathematical models of the growth and interaction of subclonal cancer populations. By embedding the time course data and differential equation models into a Bayesian inference framework, we can estimate the strength of positive and negative interactions between subclonal populations during treatment and identify key mechanisms driving cell communication. Our analyses of patient derived samples further indicates that heterogeneous multi-clonal ER+ breast cell populations evolve to acquire alternative signaling states that drive cell cycle progression independent of estrogen availability, and that cells can cooperate to survive during therapy through the increased production and local sharing of growth promoting factors. 					    				     			    			   		    		    		  									{% include happy_hour. html %}						&lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									 				 {% include schedule_menu. html %}			 											      		      									Click to show abstracts						            "

Many are confused, rely on less than reliable sources for information, and reject scientific authorities equating the evolution of knowledge to lack of expertise. Given the current situation: what is our role and responsibility as educators to help our students be more informed, critical thinkers? How must we empower them through education to identify reliable sources and to better understand the scientific process? In this talk, we will reflect on ways in which we can respond to the current knowledge deficit, and why it is our duty to do so.

Chemotaxis is important to many of the things cells do in vivo, particularly during development and disease. It is also a favourite topic for mathematical biologists. However, despite decades of studies of how cells can interpret chemotactic gradients, there has been very little attention to how gradients form, and where the information comes from. We have studied a particularly interesting aspect of this problem - self-generated gradients, in which cells form their own gradients at the same time as interpreting them and migrating up them. Self-generated gradients are fascinating, and ideal for mathematical biologists - they are so dynamic that they are nearly impossible to measure, and they incorporate multiple levels of feedback. I will describe how we use modelling, mathematics and experiments on Dictyostelium and cancer cells to understand different self-generated gradients. In particular I will show how cells can solve arbitrarily complex mazes, escape from tumours, and use the information in a gradient to move down-gradient as well as up-gradient. 					    				     			    			   		    		    		  									{% include happy_hour. html %}						&lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									 				 {% include schedule_menu. html %}			 											      		      									Click to show abstracts						            "

The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

    "body": "2020/06/08 - Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. We will probably remember these days, in years to come, as a true opportunity to contribute to the global fight against the pandemic. Predictive mathematical models that capture the underlying mechanistic biology of specific processes are at the heart of everything we do. The COVID-19 virus pandemic has brought into sharp focus the critical importance of mathematical models in both making predictions about current trends in the disease dynamics but also how specific interventions, such as social distancing, might modify them. Understanding these interventions theoretically becomes important not only for mathematical biologists, but also for politicians and other decision makers. Most of the our society members are currently doing some form of social distancing, as is a large proportion of the world. In these confined and difficult times, anxiety and stress are running high. But it is important to remember that we have the power of mathematical modelling behind us. Their predictive ability illustrates why we must slowdown the spread of this virus by staying home. Flattening the curve has become our new mantra. Importantly mathematical modelling will also help us decide how to best end this quarantine. We are at a key point in the history of our society where our models are helping to inform policy decisions that impact millions of lives. Therefore it is fundamental that we make every effort to articulate as clearly as possible what mathematical models are, what they can be used for, and what are their limitations. The integration of mathematics and biology may sound strange at first to the public. But if you find yourself in a situation where you need to explain why certain decisions are being made, please take the time to do so. Articulate the role of predictive mathematical models, but not as something magical, even though they might seem so at times. Rather that they are based on our understanding of the physical and biological processes that underly the spread of this disease. We are a diverse group of scientists and educators who work at the interface of many disciplines not just epidemiology. Our society does have a dedicated subgroup in Mathematical Epidemiology and I encourage you join them if you are interested in this area of research or if you want to learn more. We also have 7 other subgroups covering everything from development to oncology and more - I’m extremely proud of our research diversity. The purpose of this email was to shine a little light and say thank you, to celebrate the wonderful discipline we are part of and highlight the important role mathematical models are playing right now. We are fortunate in many ways, with our ability to more readily work from home than most disciplines. We can make predictions about disease dynamics without ever actually treating a patient or being forced to make difficult decisions in medical care. We can run thousands of realisations of an experiment in a fraction of the time it would take in real life. We can make rigorously constrained predictions about the spread of an epidemic and how to slow it down. Ultimately the countermeasures needed to control and end this pandemic will rely on biomedical research on drugs and vaccines. But again, their impact can and should be studied through the lens of mathematical modelling. I would be remiss if I didn’t give a special thanks to our colleagues, friends and family members in the medical profession. Without their frontline action flattening the curve becomes meaningless. Stay safe, stay home and celebrate mathematical biology! -Sandy Anderson, SMB President "

						    			The concept of the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) has been fundamental to the development of evolutionary game theory. It represents an equilibrial evolutionary state in which no rare invader can grow in population size. With additional work, the ESS concept has been formalized and united with other stability concepts such as convergent stabil- ity, neighborhood invasion stability, and mutual invisibility. Other work on evolutionary models, however, shows the possibility of unstable and/or non-equilibrial dynamics such as limit cycles and evolutionary suicide. Such “pathologies” remain outside of a well-defined context, especially the currently defined stability concepts of evolutionary games. Ripa et al. (2009) offer a possible reconciliation between work on non-equilibrial dynamics and the ESS concept. They noticed that the systems they analyzed show non-equilibrial dynam- ics when under-saturated and “far” from the ESS and that getting “closer” to the ESS through the addition of more species stabilized their systems. To that end, we analyzed three models of evolution, two predator-prey models and one competition model of evolu- tionary suicide, to see how the degree of saturation affects the stability of the system. In the predator-prey models, stability is linked to degree of saturation. Specifically, a fully saturated community will only show stable dynamics, and unstable dynamics occur only when the community is under-saturated. With the competition model, we demonstrate it to be permanently under-saturated, likely showing such extreme dynamics for this rea- son. Though not a general proof, our analysis of the models provide evidence of the link between community saturation and evolutionary dynamics. Our results offer a possible placement of these unstable and non-equilibrial dynamics into a wider framework. In addi- tion, the results concur with previous results showing greater evolutionary response to less biodiversity and clarifies the effect of extrinsic vs. intrinsic non-equilibrial evolutionary dynamics on a community.

						    			How do nitrogen and phosphorus availability impact infectious disease, and what are the reciprocal effects of pathogens on ecosystem nutrient dynamics? These questions are fundamental to understanding the coupling between disease dynamics and nutrient cycles, yet disease-ecosystem relationships are often overlooked.  Relationships linking infectious disease with ecosystem nutrient dynamics are multidirectional and can form feedback loops, though the dynamic interdependence of these processes is little understood. We illustrate the impact of disease-ecosystem feedback loops for the dynamics of both infection outcomes and ecosystem nutrients using a simple mathematical model. The model is a nonsmooth system of ordinary differential equations combining approaches from classical ecological models (logistic and droop growth) and epidemiological models (disease transmission). Our model incorporates the effects of nutrient availability on growth rates of susceptible and infected hosts, as well as the return of nutrients to the environment following host death. Despite the simplicity of this model, our results illustrate complex dynamics in host populations, infection patterns, and ecosystem nutrients that can arise from even a simple disease-nutrient feedback.

						    			Societies have always struggled with the causes and effects of violence, but only recently has there been a drive to better understand violence as a disease and to consider it from a public health perspective. Through the work of many physicians and psychologists we have realized violence is less like a moral failing and more like a disease. This realization unified professionals from the medical/epidemiological fields and those in psychology in a common goal to end violence and help heal those exposed to it. Recently, interesting analogies have been made between community-level infectious disease epidemiology and how violence spreads within a community. Experts in public health and medicine have suggested that an epidemiological framework could be used to study violence.
Infectious disease studies are often approached from two different scales: outbreak/community and immune system/individual. At both the epidemiological/community and immune system/individual scales, mathematical modeling of infectious disease dynamics plays an important role. Each scale has been modeled in isolation from the other; however, there is a natural connection between the epidemiological and immune system dynamics, since a person’s immune response determines the likelihood of transmission to others. Thus, there has been a push to consider both scales in the multi-scale integrated approach of Immuno-Epidemiological (IE) modeling. We plan to apply the approaches used for IE modeling to violence by employing the epidemiological part of the model to explore violence spread on the community level and the immune system model to look at the impact that violence exposure has on an individual with respect to increasing their propensity to commit violence.
In this talk I will expand on and formalize the analogy of violence as an infectious disease and show how the well-developed principles of mathematical epidemiology and immunology is a useful framework for understanding the dynamics of violence. Next, we will look at a preliminary susceptible-exposed-infected (SEI) mathematical model for violence spread on the community level and compare this model with traditional disease modeling. Then we will explore some basic equilibrium and stability analysis of the SEI model and look at the real-world interpretations of this analysis.

						    			Per capita recruitment is a parameter that determines most of the variation in population growth rate in wild temperate ungulates and it is generally estimated by young:female ratio. It has been proposed that this approach should be improved since only count data is used in most cases and the probability of observing calves at heel declines with the age of the calf because it is more independent of the mother. In this study, we propose an alternative method to estimate calf density (ACD) using pregnancy rate obtained from hormonal fecal metabolites and total density estimates. Then we use ACD to calculate recruitment by young:female ratio and compare the results with recruitment estimates using traditional count data (TCD). To set the parameters of ACD we used information of a partially-migratory guanaco (Lama guanicoe) population of La Payunia Provincial Reserve (Mendoza-Argentina). We calculated ACD by the following equation:A=p×h×s×D (eq. 1), where p is the pregnancy rate (0.32), s is the probability of survival (0.61), h is female's proportion (0.60), D is total density and A is calf density. First, we ran a data simulation to calculate A, using p, h, and s as deterministic parameters and D as a random parameter with a Log-Normal distribution. With the simulated data, we calculated per capita recruitment (R) and we adjusted a density-dependent model, as is expected for large ungulates: LogR=-0,179*D*[exp⁡(-0,013*D)] (eq. 2). Second, we used real data of four population surveys to estimate density by ACD. To do this we replaced the D term of the eq. 1 with field data and then, we calculated recruitment using those results. All the other terms of eq. 1 were kept the same because they belong to the population under study. Third, we estimated recruitment by young:female ratio using count data of the same surveys and compared real data recruitment estimations by ACD and TCD. Both estimations seem to follow the same pattern of the simulated data. However, recruitment obtained using ACD (0.09; 0.06; 0.07; 0.05) were lower than those calculated by TCD (0.36; 0.10; 0.31; 0.18). We hypothesized two main reasons: 1) our estimation is assuming a constant pregnancy rate; therefore, if new pregnant females entered the area under study from nearby regions from one year to the other, that information was not considered and could have led to an underestimation of recruitment by ACD. 2) In general, only a small number of calves is counted in population surveys, which may increase data dispersion, and as a consequence an overestimation of recruitment by TCD. Our innovative approach using total density estimations and pregnancy data might be useful to estimate young densities avoiding the problems of counting calves. As recruitment is one of the most important parameters to make management decisions like population control, our approach might be an alternative to reduce count data biases and should be tested in other ungulates populations.

						    			Stochastic fluctuations in transmission may increase the probability of extinction of pathogens. While overuse of antibiotics leads to the emergence of new resistant strains in population by lowering its fitness cost, other socioeconomic factors may change the selection pressure and increase the probability of extinc- tion of the resistant strain. We develop a stochastic model of drug-resistance integrating socioeconomic growth in population to study the dynamics of extinction of resistant strain in the community, where it competes with the existing sensitive strain. We analytically derive the extinction threshold from the stochastic model using the multi-type branching process theory and obtain conditions for pathogen ex- tinction or persistence in population. Using numerical simulations, we compute the extinction probability, which shows a good estimate of values obtained from the branching process. Sensitivity analysis of the model also identifies parameters that have the most impact on the extinction of the strains. Although the transmission potential of respective strains plays a major role in extinction, our results illustrate that higher income, awareness, lower antibiotic use may increase the chance of extinction significantly by lowering antibiotic misuse. These analyses are beneficial to health policy makers and may quantify some parameters which are important to control the situation.

						    			Our lab studies small bacterial communities that degrade polluting industrial waste fluids. While our standard species combination can degrade some 40% of the pollutants, we hypothesize that a) the community could improve over time and b) that combinations with other species may be even more efficient. We now ask whether we can assemble and breed new communities with improved degradation efficiency. Previous attempts to experimentally select for community functions, such as host phenotypes and degradation or production of certain chemicals, have shown mixed results. Fundamentally, the experimental design needs to maintain a variance in the community function and ensure that the trait that forms the basis of the function is inherited between transfers. Further, the selection method should reduce conflicts between different species and the conflict of interest between population growth and community functions, while avoiding cheater phenotypes and inadvertent selection for biomass yield. Two main experimental designs have so far been used for experimental community selection. We evaluate and compare these, and a new method that we propose, by developing theoretical models and computational simulations of the selection methods. Our first results have given us a basal understanding of how the different selection methods work on a community level. Further, the simulations show that our proposed design can explore different species combinations to select for pollutant degradation among small communities. In addition, mutations and possible mixing between communities introduce the variance between communities that allows for evolution in the long term.  We now explore how robust the results are to model assumptions. Our study can aid the design of future artificial community selection experiments, and contribute to our fundamental understanding of multi-level selection.

						    			Life-history strategies are a crucial aspect of life, which are complicated in group-living species, where pay-offs additionally depend on others’ behaviours. Previous theoretical models of public goods games have generally focused on the amounts individuals contribute to the public good. Yet a much less-studied strategic aspect of public goods games, the timing of contri- butions, can also have dramatic consequences for individual and collective performance. Here, we develop two stage game theoretical models to explore how the timing of contributions evolves. In the first stage, individuals contrib- ute to a threshold public good based on a performance schedule. The second stage begins once the threshold is met, and the individuals then compete as a function of their performance. We show how contributing rapidly is not necessarily optimal, because delayers can act as ‘cheats,’ avoiding contributing while reaping the benefits of the public good. However, delaying too long can put the delayers at a disadvantage as they may be ill-equipped to compete. These effects lead to bistability in a single group, and spatial diversity among multiple interacting groups.

						    			Marine protected areas (MPAs) are being implemented globally to achieve conservation goals and benefit fisheries. However, MPAs require adaptive management to determine whether they are meeting their stated goals. This requires projection of the timing of increased performance after MPA establishment. Analyses of the projection of abundance and biomass have identified the information required and the expected timelines for meeting conservation goals. Projection of fishery yield, is more complex because it involves uncertain larval connectivity and the way in which the fishery is managed. Here, we develop a two-patch model with age structure represented by a renewal equation model to understand and to project the initial timing of the increase in fishery yield from larvae exported outside the MPA. By convolving a species-specific recruitment index with a yield-per-recruit equation, we are able to derive a yield function and yield timescale for each species. A key result is that the projection of yield is a weighted moving average of the larval production due to the projected MPA biomass, with the weightings being the age reversed age distribution of yield. Notably, this links MPA management to fishery management. Yield projection differs from the projection of MPA biomass in the sense that it depends on an uncertain factor due to uncertain connectivity. We demonstrate this mechanism with life histories of 16 harvested species found along the Pacific coast of the United States. The lag between the time of peak biomass within the MPA and the time that the increased fishery yield reaches its maximum depends on the pattern of the contribution to yield at each age. This age distribution of yield in turn depends on the age-dependent patterns of growth, natural mortality, and harvest. For the 16 species we considered, that lag ranged from 7 to 16 years. This general model and the range of exemplary species provide broadly applicable general guidance for this important emerging aspect of fisheries management.

						    			Mutualistic species vary in their level of partner specificity; yet, the evolutionary mechanisms which underpin partner specificity and generalism are not yet fully understood. One factor which may underpin variation in specificity is the degree of antagonism/cooperation in the relationship between hosts and symbionts. It is possible that mutualist hosts cooperatively specialize, maximizing mutual symbiotic benefit with a preferred symbiont, or antagonistically specialize, maximizing resource extraction from a preferred symbiont. Specialization in a preferred symbiont reduces the benefit of association with non-preferred symbionts, while generalists receive similar benefit from all symbionts. Here, we employ evolutionary game dynamics and adaptive dynamics in order to assess the evolutionary stability of cooperative specialization, antagonistic specialization, and generalism. When hosts specialize cooperatively, our system is bistable, favoring one of the specialist hosts and its preferred symbiont. When hosts specialized antagonistically, host and symbiont frequencies cycle continuously when average specialist payoff is greater than average symbiont payoffs. Higher average generalist payoff causes generalism to be an evolutionary stable strategy. Cooperative specialization unilaterally favors greater cooperation between specialist hosts and preferred symbionts, while antagonistic specialization leads to an evolutionary arms race in which symbionts attempt to escape host exploitation. We conclude that the cooperation-antagonism continuum which exists in mutualisms may play a key role in determining the pattern of partner specificity which develops within mutualistic relationships.

						    			Many biological systems are spatially organised, from animals and plants to microbial communities. Mathematical modelling can help us improve our understanding of, and design better-informed experiments to probe, the dynamics of such systems. The development of computational tools for modelling spatially organised biological systems has largely focused on either so-called agent-based models or on physico-chemical models based on partial differential equations (PDEs) Agent-based models can readily incorporate cell-specific properties such as speciation, cell cycle dynamics, and replication. However, these models typically allow limited spatial resolution for chemical dynamics, have a high computational cost, and can be affected from user-implementation choices, such as the chosen sequence of simulation updating rules. In contrast, PDE-based models allow a much finer grained simulation based on densities of state variables and are well suited to simulations based on physical properties, geometry, mechanical motion, and chemical reactions; however, cell-specific attributes cannot be readily incorporated in these models. Here, we combine the benefits of agent-based and PDE models, by extending an existing software library, Chaste, to allow coupling between agent-based and PDE models. Chaste is a modular, open-source PDE solver platform that is widely used by the systems biology community already. It utilises finite element solvers to simulate individual reaction-diffusion equations, coupled to a mesh-based layer that defines structures acting as chemical sources or sinks. These PDE solvers may be solved across a mutable mesh embedded with a wide range of cell-based modelling paradigms with easily customisable modular cell behaviours, aspects enhanced when compared to similar softwares. Here, we expand this CHASTE functionality to allow the simulation of complex reaction-diffusion dynamics with multiple PDE variables and multiple cell structures. The resulting system will allows us to model and simulate multicellular systems coupled through any number of shared or communicated chemicals. As such, the new system will be suitable to study the dynamics of biological systems such as bacterial biofilms. In our own work, we aim to use this extended CHASTE platform to simulate early evolution of protocellular metabolic systems, in particular, reaction systems that are separated across cell-like phase separations in an otherwise homogenous primordial soup. Spatial dynamics in such early metabolic systems have not been considered to date and it will be interesting to characterise what kind of system dynamics can emerge under different parameter regimes of metabolite diffusion, phase dynamics, and reaction kinetics.

						    			Predicting how species respond to dynamically changing and novel environments is crucial for guiding conservation and mitigation strategies. Phenotypic plasticity is a mechanism of trait variation demonstrably important in determining how individuals and populations adapt to environmental change. The effects of phenotypic plasticity can be quantified in individuals by measuring environment-trait relationships, but it is often difficult to predict how phenotypic plasticity affects populations from environment-trait relationships alone. Variation in the life-history traits expressed by individuals may alter population processes, and this in turn can feedback to induce further variation in the traits expressed by individuals. This means the assumption that environment-trait relationships validated for individuals are representative of how populations respond to environmental change risks mischaracterising the effect of environmental change on populations. Predicting the effect of phenotypic plasticity on populations necessitates the development and utilisation of specialised predictive tools able to integrate empirically verified mechanisms of trait variation into a population's dynamical processes. We have derived a novel general mathematical framework linking trait variation due to phenotypic plasticity to population dynamics which we apply to the classical example of Nicholson's blowflies. This application reveals a rich set of counter-intuitive population-dynamical behaviours and highlights how seemingly sensible predictions about how environment-trait relationships generalise to population responses break down in the context of a populations dynamical processes. Our results demonstrate the importance of the interplay between phenotypic plasticity and population dynamics and the need to account for the effects of trait variation when making predictions about population responses to environmental change.

						    			Amid global pandemics and climate change, it is clear that coupled models of human and environmental systems are needed. These socio-ecological models have been used to understand fisheries, disease spread, and deforestation. These models have only recently been used to understand how human actions and behavior affect coral reef fisheries, with a focus on shifts to alternative stable states. We extend this work to study the effect of catastrophes, e.g. hurricanes, on these systems. We show the conditions necessary for long-term coral reef health with fishing. We also examine the effect of the disturbance regime (timing, magnitude, type) on the overall system dynamics. These results both advance our understanding of catastrophes and socio-ecological systems as well as point to ways to build fisheries that are robust to rare events.

						    			The evolution of multicellularity is a major evolutionary transition: individual cells give up their reproductive autonomy to form aggregates. Aggregation  evolves because it can confer a fitness advantage over unicellularity, e.g. because of protection from predators, functional specialisation or because aggregates can respond to environmental cues unavailable to single cells. These aggregate-level properties arise from cell-cell interactions, and determine the evolutionary course of the cells by imposing novel selection pressures. Thus, the evolutionary feedback between cell interactions and group-level properties is at the root of the evolution of multicellularity.
We explore the emergence of multicellular aggregates in a computational model where a population of cells searches for resources by chemotaxis in a spatially and temporally noisy gradient. Cells can evolve their adhesion to one another, and are selected on a cell's distance from the source of the gradient as a proxy for the availability of resources.
We show that undifferentiated multicellularity evolves because cell aggregates perform collective chemotaxis more efficiently than single cells. A unicellular strategy based on efficient dispersal (rather than collective movement) can also evolve when environmental changes occur frequently. We find that both strategies prevent the invasion of the other through interference competition. We conclude that collective behaviour can be an emergent driver of the evolution of adhesion - and therewith undifferentiated multicellularity.

						    			Biodiversity loss is one of the great challenges to be faced by the current and the future generations. Habitat loss and fragmentation are important sources of concern. A recent debate over the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity led to contradictory results. Some argue that habitat fragmentation has profound negative effects on biodiversity, while others challenge this view and advocate that those effects are usually negligible and mostly positive when significant. One source of disagreement comes from the scale of investigations made so far. Initial studies investigated the patch-scale mechanisms by which habitat fragmentation affects biodiversity and generally supported negative effects, for example by means of edge effects, vulnerability of small populations to stochasticity, etc. Recently, however, studies seeking a landscape-scale pattern of how habitat fragmentation impacts biodiversity failed to reach consistent results. This apparent contradiction between mechanisms and observed pattern highlighted the need for mechanistic understanding on how patch-scale mechanisms lead to landscape-scale patterns.
In this study we link patch-scale mechanisms to landscape-scale abundance patterns by means of a patch model consisting of a system of ordinary differential equations. The equations describe the populations of the patches, which are interdependent and affected by four basic demographic processes: births, deaths, immigration and emigration. We promote the link between scales by deriving an insightful expression for the landscape equilibrium abundance and a necessary and a sufficient condition for landscape extinction, all of them integrating the demographic processes of all patches. As a second step, we sought to describe birth, death, immigration and emigration rates in terms of characteristics of the patches, like patch areas and inter-patch distances. This translates our landscape equilibrium abundance expression and extinction conditions in terms of landscape traits commonly used in Landscape Ecology, like habitat amount (sum of the areas of all patches) and landscape configuration metrics (functions of the traits of all patches). We use data collected from an Individual Based Model (IBM) to illustrate each of the steps of this study.

						    			Explaining the causes and effects of different types of diversity is one of the key research missions in ecology and evolutionary biology. Plants produce numerous metabolites. There is a great diversity of metabolites between species, populations, and members of the same population. This chemodiversity has numerous ecological and economic implications. However, the mechanisms which maintain chemodiversity are still largely unknown. A theoretical framework is needed as a first step to bridge this gap in evolutionary knowledge. The goal of this project is therefore to develop mathematical and computational models linking genes, enzymes, metabolites, and ecological interactions to start building a theoretical framework for the evolutionary emergence and maintenance of plant chemodiversity. The screening hypothesis postulates that plants developed a set of biosynthetic pathways in which a great number of metabolites can quickly evolve. The more metabolites there are, the more likely it is that some have a defensive role against herbivores. Additionally, in existing models for the maintenance of other types of diversity, different types of negative frequency-dependent-selection (NFDS) frequently play an important role.
In this project, we develop models based on the screening hypothesis and NFDS to investigate whether these hypotheses can explain how observed chemodiversity may have evolved and may be maintained. We will work together closely with empiricists to produce models which can be used to predict possible and empirically testable evolutionary pathways for model species based on realistic assumptions about these species. In the first phase of the project, we develop an individual-based model of a plant population and implement it in C++. This model includes a submodel of the biosynthetic pathways which determine the metabolites each individual produces. In the pathway, a primary metabolite is modified by various enzymes. The coding and regulatory genes for these enzymes evolve through mutation, gene duplication, and gene loss. The resulting metabolite(s) determine the fitness effects of each individual genotype. On my poster, I will present the evolutionary thought behind the model and the results from the first phases of the implementation.

						    			We formulate a biofilm reactor model with suspended bacteria that accounts for thermodynamic growth inhibition. The reactor model is a chemostat style model consisting of a single replenished growth promoting substrate, a single reaction product, suspended bacteria, and wall attached bacteria in the form of a bacterial biofilm. We present stability results for the washout equilibrium and conduct a computational study. While stability conditions are similar to a chemostat model, we find that the steady-state concentration of the replenished substrate depends on its inflow concentration. In the computational study, we find that thermodynamic inhibition limits substrate utilization/ production both inside the biofilm and inside the aqueous phase, resulting in less suspended bacteria and a thinner biofilm.

						    			Ecosystem engineers are organisms characterized by interacting with other organisms thorough physical modifications of modifying their habitat. Examples of ecosystem engineers include Spartina alterniflora cordgrass or the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha. For both of these, the effect of modifying the environment can be non-local, affecting other regions farther away from the region populated by the ecosystem engineer. This shows the importance of understanding the population dynamics of ecosystem engineers in a spatial context. To do this we have developed the simplest spatially explicit model possible of ecosystem engineers, incorporating two local populations. We use this model to understand the relationship between dispersal and engineering effects, both at local and regional scales. Our main result is that the delayed Allee effect induced in the nonspatial model is extended to the spatial model, so the spread dynamics of an ecosystem engineer can be similar to the Allee case. However, there are more complex possibilities due to the effect of the environment modification.

						    			In mosaic ecosystems, multiple land types coexist as alternative stable states exhibiting distinct spatial patterns. Forest-grassland mosaics are ecologically valuable, due to their high species richness. However, anthropogenic disturbances threaten these ecosystems. Designating protected areas is one approach to preserving natural mosaics. Such work must account for climate change, yet there are few spatially-explicit models of mosaics under climate change that can predict its effects. We construct a spatially-explicit simulation model for a natural forest-grassland mosaic, parameterized for Southern Brazil. Using this model, we investigate how the spatial structure of these systems is altered under climate change and other disturbance regimes. By including local spatial interactions and fire-mediated forest recruitment, our model reproduces important spatial features of protected real-world mosaics, including the number of forest patches and overall forest cover. Multiple concurrent changes in environmental conditions have greater impacts on tree cover and spatial structure in simulated mosaics than single changes. This sensitivity reflects the narrow range of conditions under which simulated mosaics persist and emphasizes their vulnerability. Our model predicts that, in protected mosaics, climate change impacts on the fire-mediated threshold to recruitment will likely result in substantial increases in forest cover under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, with potential for mosaic loss over a broad range of initial forest cover levels. Forest cover trajectories are similar until 2150, when cover increases under RCP 8.5 outpace those under RCP 2.6. Mosaics that persist under RCP 8.5 may experience structural alterations at the patch and landscape level. Our simple model predicts several realistic aspects of spatial structure as well as plausible responses to likely regional climate shifts. Hence, further model development could provide a useful tool when building strategies for protecting these ecosystems, by informing site selection for conservation areas that will be favourable to forest-grassland mosaic under future climates.

						    			As antibiotic resistance grows more frequent for common bacterial infections, alternative treatment strategies such as phage therapy have become more widely studied in the medical field. While many studies have explored the efficacy of antibiotics, phage therapy, or synergistic combinations of antibiotics and phage, the impact of virus competition on the efficacy of antibiotic treatment has not yet been considered. Here, we model the synergy between antibiotics and two viral types, temperate and chronic, in controlling bacterial infections. We demonstrate that while combinations of antibiotic and temperate viruses exhibit synergy, competition between temperate and chronic viruses inhibits bacterial control with antibiotics. In fact, our model reveals that antibiotic treatment counterintuitively increases the bacterial load when a large fraction of the bacteria develop antibiotic-resistance.

						    			Migration can allow individuals to escape parasite infection, which can lead to a lower infection probability (prevalence) in a population and/or fewer parasites per individual (intensity). Since individuals with more parasites often have lower survival and/or fecundity, infection intensity shapes the life-history tradeoffs determining when migration is favored as a strategy to escape infection. Yet, most theory relies on susceptible-infected (SI) modeling frameworks, defining individuals as either healthy or infected, ignoring details of infection intensity. Here we develop a novel modeling approach that captures infection intensity as a spectrum, and ask under what conditions migration evolves as function of how infection intensity changes over time. We show that the relative timescales of migration and infection accumulation determine when migration is favored. We also find that population-level heterogeneity in infection intensity can lead to partial migration, where less-infected individuals migrate while more infected individuals remain resident. Our model is one of the first to consider how infection intensity can lead to migration. Our results frame migratory escape in light of infection intensity, rather than prevalence, thus demonstrating that decreased infection intensity should be considered a benefit of migration, alongside other typical drivers of migration.

						    			Weighted graphs can be used to model biological evolution under natural selection and mutation: vertices correspond to genotypes, edges correspond to mutation from one genotype to another, vertex weights correspond to fitnesses, and edge weights correspond to mutation rates.  Weinberger, Stadler, Grover and others have used Fourier decompositions of the vertex weights in terms of the eigenvectors of the edge weights, in order to characterize the 'ruggedness' of these 'adaptive landscapes'.  This Fourier analysis has been used to characterize random walks on the graphs.  But it has not been used in the actual evolutionary population dynamics under selection and mutation.  Here we find that the original spectral graph results of Collatz and Sinogowitz (1957) appear as a lower bound on the asymptotic mean fitness of the population, and the spectral gap of the mutation matrix appears in an upper bound.  This reveals an intimate connection between robustness of a population to mutation and the relaxation times of population perturbations due to mutation.

						    			Basic sanitation refers to the set of services, infrastructures, and operational installations for the supply of drinking water, sanitary sewerage, and management of solid waste. A precarious basic sanitation service contributes to the spreading of water-diseases. The delimitation of the urban and rural areas supports the public policies of sanitation investment and vector-borne control. In continental land sized countries like Brazil, this categorization has the influence of subjective aspects from peri-urban areas. When we evaluate sanitation system efficiency, we take into account that the total population services matter, which helps to understand and avoid frontier region border diseases that can potentially spread to urban regions and cause outbreaks. Recent episodes of Aedes aegypti related diseases in Brazilian regions that used to be immune, due to the geographic location and severe winters, shows that Brazilian public health is not prepared to deal with Aedes aegypti development. We propose a fuzzy rule-based system to measure the influence of sanitation and rain lack over the Aedes aegypti population dynamics. The system entries are fuzzy sets that involve four linguistic variables, which are the percentage of the urban population, as well as the percentage of served population by water supply, frequents solid waste collection, and sanitary sewerage. We use real data disclosed by the Brazilian institutions IBGE and SNIS (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística - Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics; Sistema Nacional de Informações sobre Saneamento - Brazilian sanitation information system). The system output feeds a characteristic parameter, which aims to quantify the contribution attributed to the basic sanitation of the city on the maintenance of breeding sites of Aedes aegypti during periods without rain. The fuzzy system provides a value that represents a parameter, which we couple to the age and stage-structured population projection matrix model for Aedes aegypti. A value closer to 0 means that the sanitation panorama of the city is ideal, and the Aedes aegypti population development is limited, according to lower precipitation periods. Spite of the slow development due to the water sources' lack, it is sensitive to temperature and individuals' age. Through the model, basic sanitation plays a role over stimuli for the quiescent egg, and mortality of larva and pupa during periods with a few precipitation millimeters episodes. Through this analysis, we are forecasting population dynamics fluctuations in drier periods, which is highly influenced by basic sanitation in municipalities that offer precarious sanitation services.

						    			Mutagenic drugs are promising candidates for the treatment of various RNA virus infections. By increasing the mutation rate of the virus they lead to rapid accumulation of deleterious mutation load, which is proposed to ultimately result in extinction as described by the theoretical concepts of mutational meltdown and lethal mutagenesis. However, the conditions and potential mechanisms of viral escape from the effects of mutagenic drugs have not been systematically explored. Here we investigate the population dynamics and genetics of a population under high mutation rates and discuss the probabilities of evolutionary rescue by means of three mechanisms: (1) “traditional” beneficial mutations increasing growth/fitness, (2) a mutation rate modifier (i.e., evolution of resistance), and (3) a modifier of the distribution of fitness effects, which either dampens or increases deleterious effects (i.e., evolution of tolerance). We investigate extinction times and we find that successful rescue mutations have to appear early to compensate the increasing mutational load. However, the observed stochasticity of rescue, especially by means of tolerance, highlights potential dangers of the use of mutagenic treatments that are almost impossible to capture in experimental trials.

						    			Environmental changes greatly influence the evolution of populations. In this talk, we discuss the dynamics of a population of two strains, one growing slightly faster than the other, competing for resources in a time-varying binary environment modelled by a carrying capacity that switches either randomly or periodically between states of resources abundance and scarcity. The population dynamics is characterised by demographic noise (birth and death events) coupled to the fluctuating population size. By combining analytical and simulation methods, we elucidate the similarities and differences of evolving subject to stochastic and periodic switching. We show that the population size distribution is generally broader under intermediate and fast random switching than under periodic variations, with periodic changes leading to an abrupt transition from slow to fast switching regimes. The fixation probability under intermediate/fast random and periodic switching can hence vary significantly, with markedly different asymptotic behaviours. We also determine the conditions under which the fixation probability of the slow strain is maximum when the dynamics is driven by asymmetric switching. If time permits, I will outline how our methodology also allows us to analyse the complex eco-evolutionary dynamics arising when the slow strain produces public goods benefiting the entire population.

						    			Understanding ancestral processes under selection and mutation is among the fundamental challenges in population genetics. An important concept here is the ancestral selection graph (ASG) extracted from the Moran Model. This is, however, difficult to handle, both analytically and computationally, if two or more sites (that is, gene loci or sequence sites) are considered. Here a computational approach to pruning the ASG in the case of M sites is presented. The basic idea explores any incoming selective arrow, putting a hold onto the previously-active line. Should the incoming line be determined to be the ancestral line, it becomes the new active line and the previously-active line is dismissed. The set of types (that is, haplotypes or alleles) can be modelled in terms of sequences s ∈ {0, 1}M or fitness classes w ∈ {0,..,M}. The pruning procedure so far takes advantage of using sequences, but may be adjusted to fitness. Some preliminary results for different mutation and selection parameters and the resulting mutation process on the ancestral line are presented. This is joint work with Ellen Baake.

						    			Savannas are mixed woodland-grassland ecosystems that cover fifth of Earth’s land surface. They are characterised by a continuous grass layer and a discontinuous layer of woody plants. In understanding complex savanna dynamics of main interest is the question how do trees and grasses co-exist without one dominating the other? Amongst possible explanations there has been recognized that disturbances like fires or browsing and grazing may play fundamental role. There is quite rich literature on models of tree-grass coexistence in savannas with such non-equilibrium approach. From the mathematical point of view models containing many different factors often lack formal stochasticity and their analysis is usually based on numerical simulations. Moreover, another important determinant of savanna structure - water availability - is of less unpredictable nature following seasonality. Most of the plants growth happens during wet seasons while large amounts of dry grasses additionally support fires during dry seasons. These effects usually are not directly included in existing models of savanna dynamics. We introduced two minimalistic models of tree-grass coexistence driven by fire disturbances. We provided careful mathematical analysis of appropriate piecewise deterministic Markov process and showed the existence of a unique stationary distribution of tree and grass biomasses using the tools of stochastic semigroup theory. Continuing this approach we work on analytic results for more realistic setting including the seasonality via its effects on plants growth rate as well as a probability of occurrence and intensity of fires. Moreover, we want to include in the final model also grazing and browsing effects (similarly to the one provided in (6) but along with seasonality).

						    			In predator-prey theory, the predator can affect on prey population by the killing of the prey and by causing predation fear on the prey population. The prey population also adjusts some behavioral approaches to reduce their predation risk which may influence their long term survival. In the present study, we formulate a predator-prey model dividing the prey population into two stages: juvenile and adult. We assume that when adult preys are sensitive to predation, they adapt group defense as an anti-predator strategy to lower their predation risk. To include group defense in the adult prey population, we consider Holling type IV functional responses for adult prey and predator interaction. But group defense has a negative effect by decreasing their reproduction potential. A parameter predator-taxis sensitivity introduces to interlink benefits of group defense and its costs. Increasing predator-taxis sensitivity also increases the group defense level of adult preys and benefits them by lowering predation risk. But also causes a detrimental effect by decreasing their reproduction rate simultaneously. We study some mathematical properties such as positivity, boundedness, local stability of equilibrium points, and bifurcation behaviors of the model. Our result suggests that the maturation rate can destabilize the system by producing oscillatory coexistence. For higher maturation rate the predator population suddenly extinct from the system, where oscillatory coexistence may disappear and the system becomes stable around the predator-free state. We also observe that predator-taxis sensitivity enhances the destabilizing nature of the system. However, for increasing the level of fear, the destabilization vanishes and the system shows stable behavior. It is also observed that predator- taxis sensitivity can be beneficial for adult prey as their density may increase with increasing the values of predator-taxis sensitivity. We also notice that above a threshold value of predator- taxis sensitivity the system shows bistable behavior. Our fear-induced stage-structured model exhibits interesting and rich dynamical behaviors.

						    			Fragmentation of the natural landscapes due to human activity has an undeniable undeniable eundeniable effect over the wildlife. The most known example being deforestation and the subsequent extinction of forest inhabiting species. In this context, a natural question to ask is: what is the minimum habitat size that allows for (co)existence of the species living in a given environment? The work described here then sought to address this inquiry for the particular case of 3 ecologically interacting species: a prey, its predator and a common resource. A system known as an intraguild predation module. We proposed and studied a model consisting of 3 coupled reaction-di_x000B_usion partial differential equations. In addition to numerical simulations, we used a method of approximation based on variational principles capable of providing analytical estimates for critical habitat sizes for the coexistence of the species involved in the proposed model. life.

						    			Structured population models, which account for the state of individuals given features such as age, gender, and size, are widely used in the fields of ecology and biology. In this paper, we consider an age-structured population model describing the population of adults and juveniles. The model consists of a system of ordinary and neutral delay differential equations. We present an explicit solution to the model using a generalization of the Lambert W function called the r-Lambert W function. The r-Lambert W function, denoted Wr(a), is a function satisfying Wr(a)e^(W_r(a))+rWr(a)-a=0, where a is a nonzero complex number and r is a real number. Numerical simulations with varying parameters and initial conditions are done to illustrate the obtained solution.

						    			Microbial life is highly abundant in the biosphere. Macroscopic lifeforms are no exception. We harbor a large number of microorganisms in different parts of our bodies, often referred to as the microbiome. What separates us from abiotic habitats is that we undergo life-cycles.
We have developed stochastic models to understand the consequences of host life-history on the ecology of the microbiome. Particularly, we focus on the effect of the host lifespan and initial microbiome. Our results point at the limits imposed by life-history, but also at the diverse dynamics, even in contexts free of selection at the level of microbes and hosts. Multiple reported experimental observations in organisms like nematodes, fruit flies, and zebrafish can be unified around colonization. These include the emergence and coexistence of alternative microbiome states, the persistence of microbe-free hosts, and the inconsistent occurrence of microbial types.

						    			Coral reefs rank among the highest-biodiversity habitats in the world, hosting many fish and invertebrate species found nowhere else. Additionally, reef ecosystems generate billions of dollars in revenue annually for coastal communities via fishing and tourism. However, from the Caribbean to Australia, coral reefs are in decline worldwide. Causes of this include anthropogenic stressors such as overfishing and excess input of nitrogen and other nutrients. To evaluate the threats posed to reefs by these processes, I simulate reef dynamics using a mechanistic, spatially explicit model fit using field data. I find three major regimes: one where coral dominates with periodic algal blooms, one where coral and algae coexist, and one where coral is driven to extinction by algae, in order from lowest to highest fishing rates. For moderate fishing rates, both a healthy coral population and a profitable local fishing industry can exist. Also, establishing a marine protected area (MPA) with no fishing in 20 percent of the simulated area is enough to maintain the coral-dominant equilibrium in the rest of the system, even when fishing rates outside the MPA are very high. Decreasing nutrient input into the system can also shift it towards the coral-dominant equilibrium. The rates of nutrient loading at which regime shifts are predicted to occur vary nonlinearly with fishing rate.

						    			Foraging site constancy, or repeated return to the same location forage, is an important aspect of bumble bee behaviour, and should therefore be an important consideration when using modelling to predict the pollination services provided by bumble bees. However, it is unknown exactly how bumble bees select their foraging site, and most modelling studies do not account for this uncertainty. We used an individual based model to explore how predictions of pollination services and bee fitness change under different foraging site selection methods. Pollination services are measured as the percent of fields and number of flowers visited, and bee fitness is measured as the amount of different resource types collected and using behavioural budgets. We tested two different site-reconnaissance or searching methods (random and realistic exploration behaviour) and four different site- selection methods (random and optimizing based on distance from the nest, local wildflower density, or net rate of energy return), as well as comparing results on landscapes with different total amounts of resource and proportional amounts of crop. We found that site- selection methods have a greater impact on crop pollination services and bee fitness than do site-reconnaissance or landscape characteristics, indicating that the site-selection method is an important consideration when modelling bumble bee pollination services. In general, site-selection based on optimizing for the net rate of energy return leads to both the highest crop pollination services and the longest foraging trips. The percent of crop fields visited, amount of time spent foraging, number of foraging sites located in crops, and the number of flowers visited may be used to make hypotheses about how real bees select their foraging sites.

						    			Microorganisms live in environments that often fluctuate between mild and harsh conditions. Although such fluctuations are bound to cause local extinctions and thereby affect species diversity in microbial communities, it is still unknown (i) how species diversity changes over the rate of environmental fluctuations and (ii) how this relates to changes in species interactions. Here, we use a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of resources, toxins and species abundances in a chemostat where resource supplies switch between scarce and abundant. Over the majority of the explored parameter space, species compete with one another, but the strength of competition between species pairs changed over the switching rate in a pattern that depended on their sensitivity to toxins. When their toxin sensitivities were low, an effect of competition was highest at a low switching rate. At other toxin sensitivity values, competition was instead highest at intermediate or high switching rates. In communities of up to ten species, the strength of competition in species pairs was a good predictor for how community beta diversity changed over the environmental switching rate: diversity was lowest when competition was highest. This shows that an analysis of pairwise species interactions can be used to estimate how beta diversity changes over environmental switching rates. Our results also indicate that predicting how environmental switching affects communities is very difficult a priori, as it depends on the properties of its members, such as their tolerance to environmental toxicity. This may explain the contradicting results of some earlier studies on the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.

						    			Fragmentation of natural landscapes is an ongoing process, mainly led by human activities, such as urban growth, roadway construction and farming. This phenomena may lead to many changes in the dynamics of populations that live in such landscapes, posing new challenges to our understanding of population persistence and diversity therein.
One of the first approaches on how we may treat such problems mathematically was given by Shigesada  in 1986, where a single population invading an infinite unidimensional habitat, composed of two types of patches layed on the real line alternately, is considered.  Along that, theoretical aspects of how populations behave on the borders between different types of patches were developed, unraveling new classes of realistic boundary conditions for spatial ecology models, giving us new results and insights in this field.
In this work we consider an Intraguild Predation (IGP) model, a community module composed of two consumers of a shared resource, with a predation relation between such consumers, usually referred as IG-Prey and IG-Predator. First we deal with invasions of both IG-Prey and IG-Predator in an homogeneous landscape, with either the resource established alone or together with the other consumer. Then, using Cobbold and Yurk's homogenization technique, we formulate and investigate the problem in a periodic habitat, composed of two types of patches where IGP relations are present, but allowed to have different parameters, such as less resource consumption, enhanced mortality or reduced resource productivity in one of the patches.
Our results show that coexistence  between IG-Prey and IG-Predator is possible within a range of resource productivity in homogeneous landscapes, being such range determined via analysis of the minimal speeds of invasion. In heterogeneous landscapes, with IGP being viable on both patches, we find that the necessary conditions for coexistence may be relaxed given certain movement behavior of both consumers and resource alike, whilst some configurations restrict such condition. We also explore how the ranges of coexistence in terms of resource productivity change with the sizes of the two habitat types considered, finding that such regions are also diminished or enlarged, depending on the movement behavior of the IGP populations.

						    			A population of genetically identical cells is phenotypically heterogeneous. The heterogeneity is partially inherited over generations and can work as a bet-hedging strategy of the survival of the population under fluctuating environments. A typical instance of the bet-hedging strategy is the bacterial persistence. To understand such strategies, we need to identify the phenotypes of each cell and its inheritance. For this purpose, recent advancements in single-cell analysis and microfluidic devices offer us useful lineage data, though such data accommodate but do not explicitly show the phenotypic information of each cell. Several studies have attempted to overcome the difficulty by inferring the phenotypes from lineage data via latent-variable estimation. However, we must correct the bias caused by the growth of the population, which we call the survivorship bias, in the estimation. In this work, we characterize the survivorship bias and establish a correction method of the bias. Then, we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) type latent variable estimation, which we call Lineage EM algorithm (LEM). LEM is bias-free and applicable to various kinds of lineage data to characterize the phenotype of the cells. Finally, we apply LEM to a synthetic and a real lineage tree of E. coli and validate the performance.

First, we analyze a quasispecies system with niche diversification and mutator effect.  We examine the case with different fitness landscapes in the first and second habitats and migration flow between them.  It is shown that such systems have rich phase structure, governed by the transition and mutation rates. Second,  we focus on such modifications of classical models of microbiological evolution that include explicit specification on nutrition type. For the cases with one and multiple common nutrients, the evolutionary dynamics of the population is discussed.

						    			Spatial synchronization in many biological systems are known to develop from short-range interactions of local oscillators. Locally-coupled ecological oscillators with noise and two-cycle behavior undergo a phase transition from incoherence to synchrony. These phase transitions exist in the Ising universality class, ensuring that the stationary properties of the ecological systems can be replicated by the simple Ising model. The universal properties shared by all the models in the universality class match that of the Ising model. Here we are interested in studying the dynamical properties shared between the ecological oscillators and the Ising model as synchronization is a dynamic phenomenon. We show that we need to go beyond the simple Ising model with nearest neighbor coupling and add a memory term to explain the tendency of local oscillators to maintain their phase of oscillations. We infer the Ising parameters using maximum likelihood methods by representing the ecological oscillators with the dynamical Ising model with memory. This correspondence to the dynamical Ising model is useful as it reveals that the spatial properties arise independent of local dynamics and the Ising parameters play a clear role in both understanding and predicting the dynamics of the ecological system. We study the location of phase transition in Ising parameter space and the ability of the dynamical Ising model to predict the future dynamics. We find that the simple dynamical Ising model is reasonable good at representing the ecological oscillators. This agreement between the dynamics of spatially-coupled ecological oscillators and the dynamical Ising model suggests the potential for simplification of many complex biological systems.

						    			Sexes of a species show different characteristics beyond the differences in their sex- ual organs; this is known as sexual dimorphism and applies to immunocompetence as well. Immunocompetence is the ability of an individual to mount an immune response when exposed to pathogens. Females are shown to have increased longevity that comes with higher immunocompetence as compared to males and this may also lead to an increased probability of autoimmune disease in females. However, for some species such as pipefishes and seahorses belonging to the Syngnathid family, studies show that the males have a higher immunocompetence. Experimental evidences suggest that this could be due to the fact that these males undergo pregnancy i.e. the males have brood pouches where the eggs are fertilized; the fathers provide oxygen and nutrition to their offspring until they give birth to the juveniles. Therefore, an increase in immunocompetence may also be related to the amount of parental investment. In this study, using state dependent life-history theory, we show that for most species systems it is optimal to invest more in immunocompetence when the time spent in parental investment is longer. Our findings also show that an increase in parental investment brings about an earlier immunosenescence i.e. the gradual deterioration of the immune system that occurs with aging. We observe that an increase in investment towards immunocompetence is more pronounced in short-lived species with long brooding periods whereas species with a longer lifespan allocate more reserves towards offspring production. Our model also accounts for intraspecies scenarios: if a sex spends a longer fraction of its reproductive season in pregnancy or brooding (as compared to the other sex), then we find that this sex would invest more towards immunocompetence.

						    			Human  action  fragments  the  natural  habitat  of  several  species  all  around the world.  Understanding the effects of fragmentation to ecosystems is key to elaborate the best policies to avoid species extinctions.  Therefore,  it is important  to  study  how  the  populations  and  ecosystems  respond  to  these kinds of changes in landscapes.  In this work, we use numerical methods to simulate reaction-diffusion equations in artificial landscapes generated with different structural distributions while keeping the total amount of habitat constant.  This guarantees we are observing phenomena caused by fragmentation per se. We  discuss  the  net  effects  of  fragmentation  into  the  steady total population.  In order to do that correctly, we established the correlation between fragmentation metrics with fixed amount of habitat, to ensure that  conclusions  are  not  biased  by  interdependencies  of  metrics.   We  have also analytically calculated the critical size to allow population growth for bidimensional landscapes within our model, with given symmetries.  These results prove that habitat area is not the only factor when it comes to population settling, and hence patch shape matters.  Recent explorations on our model revel the presence of different movement scales, intra-patch and inter-patches.   Future  prospects  of  this  project  are  studying  how  fragmentation affects  features  of  population  spatial  distribution  and  investigations  about regimes of fragmentation that allow non-interactive (or weakly interacting) subpopulations to form.  We will also explore consequences of fragmentation to communities.

						    			It is common to observe in nature the emergence of collective behavior in biological populations, such as pattern formation. In this work, we are interested in characterizing the distribution of a single-species population (such as some bacteria or vegetation), based on mathematical models that describe the spatio-temporal evolution of the density, governed by elementary processes, such as dispersion, growth, and nonlocal competition by resources. Using a generalization of the FKPP equation, we study the role that a heterogeneous environment has in the spatial organization of a population. We investigate the structures that emerge near the border from one environment to the other. We found that, depending on the shape of nonlocal interaction and other model parameters, three diﬀerent proﬁles can emerge from the interface: sustained oscillations (or spatial patterns, without amplitude decay); attenuated oscillations (with amplitude decreasing from the interface); exponential decay (without oscillations) to a flat proﬁle. We related the wavelength and the rate of decay of oscillations with the parameters of the interaction (characteristic length and form of decay with distance). We discussed how the heterogeneities of the environment allow access to information about the biological phenomena of the system, hidden in the homogeneous case, such as those that mediate competitive interactions.

						    			At all scales from molecules to ecosystems, we measure biodiversity to indicate outcomes of natural changes or threatening processes, so that we can compare these with forecasts under various management schemes.   Every biodiversity level has four basic processes – dispersal, adaptation, random change, and generation of novel ecosystems, species, or genetic variants.  How can we exploit this similarity?  Entropy is an obvious choice, being a general forecasting and measurement tool throughout science.  It is also a simple transform of the biodiversity-measure ‘profile’:  Richness; Gini-Simpson; and Shannon.  Conservation managers mostly use Richness and Shannon for biodiversity measurement, and have some forecasts for MaxEnt (Shannon) and Simpson - so there is a mismatch between what is forecast and measured.  In contrast, measures and forecasts in molecular ecology are now well developed for the entire profile of biodiversity-measures, within and between areas (Trends Ecol.Evol. 32:948).  Shannon approaches outperform others in some important tasks, such as tracing rangeshift or invasion, and genetic estimates of dispersal for input to metapopulation models.  Thus the stage is set to unify our monitoring and forecasting of these four processes that are common across all biodiversity levels, using a complete diversity profile that encompasses Richness, Shannon and Simpson.  This will integrate well with the many entropic methods in studies of the physical environment.
