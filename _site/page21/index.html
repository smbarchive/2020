Enderling@moffitt. org. 									1. Where will eSMB2020 take place?: 	  	   				The eSMB2020 conference will be held virtually. Through partnership with MathDept. org, we will utilize Sococo, Zoom, and Slack to create an immersive conference experience. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  2. What are the registration costs?: 	  	   				The registration fee is $25 for our first virtual annual meeting. You must register for the meeting through the registration website. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  3. Do I need to register if I am not presenting a poster or abstract?: 	  	   				Yes, registration is required for participation in eSMB2020. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;									4. What the poster requirements?: 	  	   				Registration is required to present a poster. Please register at your earliest convenience at smb2020. org/registration.  A tutorial video of the sococo platform is online for you to get a glimpse into what the virtual poster session will look and feel like ( http://smb2020. org/logistics/ ). Please follow the following guidelines: 													Poster dimensions: Max of 3' x 4/ (91cm x 122cm). 					Format: PDF only					File Size: Not to exceed 25MB. 					If necessary, here are instructions to reduce file size: https://www. wikihow. com/Reduce-PDF-File-Size. 					Please save your poster with the following File Name: Lastname_Firstname_XXXX. pdf, where XXXX is to be replaced by the identifier of the SMB subgroup the poster belongs to. XXXX = { CDEV, EDUC, IMMU, MEPI, NEUR, ONCO, MFBM, POPD, OTHE }. All subgroups (and corresponding codes) are listed on the subgroup page. 					Please upload your poster pdf to the Subgroup Google Drive folder that your subgroup chair emailed you. 															   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;																															  	  5. If I submitted my abstract to the Heidelberg ESMTB meeting, is it too late to transfer it to SMB2020?: 	  	   				If you have not yet transferred your abstract, please submit your abstract as a new abstract during eSMB2020 registration.  	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  6. Will the Heidelberg ESMTB meeting still take place?: 	  	   				ESMTB organizers plan to hold ESMTB in 2021 in Heidelberg. Unfortunately, this won’t be a joint meeting with the SMB. The SMB 2021 annual meeting will be held at UC Riverside. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  7. Will my talk be recorded or live-streamed?: 	  	   				The eSMB2020 conference offers the unprecedented opportunity to record talks for dissemination after the meeting. Live-streaming is currently not planned. During abstract submission, authors can select to opt in/out of recordings.  	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  8. Can I re-submit an updated abstract?: 	  	   				Yes. To submit an updated abstract, please coordinate with the SMB subgroup lead that your abstract belongs to. If your abstract does not belong to an SMB subgroup, please contact Torbjörn Lundh. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  9. Can I submit an abstract that is not affiliated with any subgroup?: 	  	   				Yes, during abstract submission you choose the option ‘none of the above’ for subgroup affiliation. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  10. Can we still organize minisymposia?: 	  	   				Please reach out to the SMB subgroup leaders that your minisymposium thematically belongs to to confirm if accommodations can be made for additional minisymopisia. Note: the mathematical oncology section is currently at capacity and cannot accept further MS submissions. Otherwise, if the MS thematically does not belong to a subgroup, please contact Torbjörn Lundh. 	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  11. When will I be notified about abstract selection?: 	  	   				All submitted abstract will be evaluated by the SMB Subgroups and conference scientific committee after the abstract submission deadline on July 15. Notification of abstract selection for poster or oral presentation will be sent before the end of July.  	   	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;			&lt;/br&gt;	  	  12. I've completed the registration form, but did not submit an abstract yet. How do I submit my abstract post-registration?: 	  	   				You can send your title and abstract to the SMB Membership Team at membership@smb. org, and they will add it to your registration. 	   	  	  	  13. How do I format my virtual poster?: 	  	   				Posters should be landscape format and saved as a single page pdf, to ensure that everybody will be able to view it on their personal computer or tablet.  When designing your poster, please chose content and font size carefully to clearly communicate your research. All accepted posters will be uploaded to a shared drive for access through Sococo during the poster session. Details will be communicated in the next couple of weeks. 	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  			"

However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.     	  			&lt;/br&gt;									    	  Conference Schedule: 	        	    * all times are listed in US Eastern Time Zone.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

However, the drugs we typically use to treat these diseases target a single protein (e. g. anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for treating diabetic retinopathy) and disregard the fact that cells within tissues are highly heterogeneous and have individualized responses that contribute to the tissue-level outcomes. To bridge the gap between protein and multi-cell/tissue-levels, my lab develops agent-based computational models and uses them in combination with experimental approaches, to predict how individual cell behaviors give rise to tissue-level adaptations. We have used agent-based modeling to simulate the structural adaptations of large and small blood vessels, skeletal muscle regeneration following injury, and immune cell trafficking and differentiation during inflammation and infection. Our studies have suggested new mechanistic hypotheses and provided suggestions for the design of novel therapies that account for the dynamic and heterogeneous interactions between different cell types within a diseased tissue. 		     		    		     			    Bio: Shayn Peirce-Cottler, Ph. D. is Professor of Biomedical Engineering with secondary appointments in the Department of Ophthalmology and Department of Plastic Surgery at the University of Virginia. Dr. Peirce-Cottler received Bachelor’s of Science degrees in Biomedical Engineering and Engineering Mechanics from The Johns Hopkins University in 1997. She earned her Ph. D. in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia in 2002. Dr. Peirce-Cottler develops and uses computational models in conjunction with experiments to study structural and functional adaptations of tissues, in both health and disease, in order to develop new therapies for inducing regeneration in injured tissues or restoring homeostasis to diseased tissues. Her lab’s core expertise is in combining agent-based computational modeling with in vivo imaging of murine experimental models to examine and control the multi-cell interactions involved in angiogenesis. Current projects in her lab seek to exploit perivascular support cells, immune cells, and stem cells to invoke tissue regeneration and curb fibrosis during acute and chronic inflammation.

While incredibly successful in motivating enormous theoretical and experimental work, there are many open questions in elucidating specific aspects of Turing-type morphogenesis in real developmental settings. I will present recent work on developing new tools and perspectives on matching Turing's idealized theory with the complexity of real biological development. This includes recent extensions to the classical theory of linear instability analysis to account for heterogeneity in space and time, curvature, growth, as well as open boundary conditions combining Turing's theory with other ideas in understanding spatial pattern formation, such as positional information. While this extends and confirms intuitive insights gained from experiments and simulations over the past few decades, it raises an enormous number of questions regarding how far we can push such extensions. I will briefly mention some of these, hopefully stimulating broader perspectives on how to develop simple yet physically interpretable theories of pattern formation. 									  											  									  									  									  								  								  								  	Daniel Lobo								  	 								  		University of Maryland, Baltimore County								  									  									  										  			&lt;/br&gt; A Turing system explains regeneration patterning and fission behavior in planaria 								  										  									  									  										  										  											  			Planarian worms have the extraordinary ability to regenerate any body part after an amputation. This ability allows them to reproduce asexually by fission, cutting themselves to produce two separated pieces each repatterning and regenerating a complete animal. The induction of this process is known to be dependent on the size of the worm as well as on environmental factors such as population density, temperature, and light intensity. Models based on Turing systems can explain the self-regulation of many biological mechanisms, from skin patterns to digit formation. Here, we combine experimental evidence with a modeling approach to show how a cross-inhibited Turing system can explain at once both the signaling mechanism of regeneration and fission in planaria. The model explains in a growing domain the precise signals that control the regeneration of the different body parts after amputations as well as when and where planaria fission, and its dependence on the worm length. We provide molecular implementations of the proposed model, which also explains the effects of environmental factors in the signaling of fission. In summary, the proposed controlled cross-inhibited Turing system represents a completely self-regulated model of the whole-body regeneration and fission signaling in planaria.

While it is known that these adhesive forces are generated by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), the regulation of CAMs is not well understood due to complex nonlinear interactions that span multiple levels of biological organization–from genetic regulation to whole-organism shape formation. We present a novel continuous model using partial differential equations that can explain the dynamic relationships between genetic regulation, CAM expression, and differential adhesion. This approach can demonstrate the mechanisms responsible for cell-sorting behaviors, cell intercalation in proliferating populations, and the involution of zebrafish germ layer cells during gastrulation. The model can predict the physical parameters controlling the amplitude and wavelength of a cellular intercalation interface as shown in vitro. We demonstrate the crucial role of N-cadherin regulation for the involution and migration of cells beyond the gradient of the morphogen Nodal during zebrafish gastrulation. Integrating the emergent spatial tissue behaviors with the regulation of genes responsible for essential cellular properties such as adhesion will pave the way toward understanding the genetic regulation of large-scale complex patterns and shapes formation in developmental, regenerative, and cancer biology.

Cell cycle duration changes dramatically during development, starting out fast to generate cells quickly and slowing down over time as the organism matures. The cell cycle may also act as a transcriptional filter to control the expression of long genes which can’t be completely transcribed in short cycles. Using mathematical simulations, we discovered an inherent trade-off where fast cycling cells serve to increase cell number while slower cycling cells contribute to cell diversity by introducing genes in a controlled manner. Simulations show that cell-cycle duration can fine tune cell number, cell diversity and cell proportions in a tissue. Our predictions are supported by comparison to single-cell RNA-seq data captured over embryonic development. Our results support the idea that cell-cycle dynamics may be important for controlling gene expression and cell fate.

Key uncertain- ties at the time were the transmission potential of the new virus as well as the case ascertainment ratio and likely full size of the epidemic. We fitted a deterministic metapopulation SEIR model of transmission to reported case information across Chinese cities as well as in other locations around the world, up until large-scale movement restrictions were imposed on 23 January. We estimated that the R0 in China was 3. 11 (95%CI, 2. 39-4. 13) and the case ascertainment ratio in Wuhan, the center of the outbreak at the time, was only 5. 0% (3. 6-7. 4), demonstrating the potential for sizable epidemics that may be difficult to control.

It is essential to effectively predict the development trend of the epidemic, including when the 2019-nCoV infection will peak, what are the specific peak value and the final size, etc. How do the large-scale directional movement of the national population and random movement of individuals influence on the national epidemic during the Spring Festival, and what is the role of the control strategies on the epidemic? Address these questions fall within the the scope of this talk. We develop a novel modeling approach with multiple control measures and parameterize the model based on a small amount of constantly updated data to quick predict the development trend and transmission risk of the disease, to reveal the development trend of the new coronavirus. We develop spatial network model to study the influences of population movement, information transmission, enhanced prevention and control measures on epidemic transmission, to identify the key factors that significantly affect the spread of disease, and to analyze the effectiveness of prevention and control measures of 2019-nCoV in- fection. The findings provide quantitative decision basis for national epidemic prevention and control.

Early in the epidemic, we estimated the basic reproduction number R0 of 2019-nCoV to be around 2. 2 (1. 43. 8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. As more data was becoming available, we estimated the age-specific case fatality ratio (CFR) by fitting a transmis- sion model to data from China, accounting for underreporting and the time delay to death. Overall CFR among all infections was 1. 6% (1. 4-1. 8) and increased considerably for the elderly, highlighting the expected burden for healthcare systems with further expansion of the COVID-19 epidemic around the globe. This presentation aims to highlight methods that can be used to inform public health authorities in real time in situations of disease emergence, with a particular focus on how to handle uncertainty.

Since these restrictions have a negative impact on the economy, there exists a strong incentive to relax these policies while protecting public health. Using a multigroup SEIR epidemiological model, we explore the costs and benefits associated with the sequential release of specific groups based on age and risk from isolation. The results suggest that properly designed staggered-release policies can do better than simultaneous-release policies in terms of protecting the most vulnerable members of a population, reducing health risks overall, and increasing economic activity.

To perform this transition, individual cells must contend with the hydrodynamic force interactions between them and the surface. In our work, we determine these interactions by combining experiments and numerical simulations. Using total internal reflection microscopy, we acquire time lapse images of fluorescent bacteria swimming near a surface. By analyzing the intensity profiles, we reconstruct the three-dimensional trajectories of the bacteria. We then input the measured trajectories into a computational fluid dynamics model – the method of images for regularized Stokeslets – and calculate the force and torque exerted on the bacteria when they swim near the surface. In this talk, we will present the technical details of the experiment, show the resulting measurements, and discuss the computational approach.

However, semen analysis in the human is currently limited to methods such as sperm counting and analysis of fixed cells. To address this, we have developed and released FAST, a free-to-use package for the high-throughput detection and tracking of large numbers of beating flagella in experimental microscopy videos. In this talk we will discuss how the combination of experimental data analysis, integrated with mathematical and numerical modelling of the elastohydrodynamic environment, can be utilised to understand the characteristics of flagellar motility in a semen sample.

Now, thanks to advances in genomics technology, we can identify which microbes are where and understand how they influence human and environmental health. But to ever effectively manipulate these microbial ecosystems to our benefit, we must understand not only their composition, but also the physics of microbial surface colonization. In this talk, I will describe how colonies of the common soil bacteria Bacillus subtilis swarm and slide along surfaces and what we know about the forces that individual bacteria experience during these processes. Understanding such forces will be crucial to identifying the physical triggers that promote or inhibit various modes of surface colonization.

Our research group uses model macroscopic experiments with typical length scales of ≈ 10 cm, but match the low Reynolds number of microoganisms by using a highly viscous silicone oil that is 105 more viscous than water but with approximately the same density. We can build laboratory scale robotic swimmers and model microorganisms that are typically ≈ 10 µm, while keeping the Reynolds much less than unity. We also explore fundamental theories such as building a laboratory scale three-link swimmer (Purcell 1977). We compare our laboratory experiments of helical flagella with complimentary numerical simulations and find good agreement. We also compare our results with theory from geometric mechanics, which predicts the translation and rotation of a three-link swimmer for a given gate.

Further complicating this picture, therapeutic resistance poses a major challenge to the design and implementation of effective cancer treatments. To overcome these hurdles, it is crucial to characterize heterogeneity within and around the tumour and to quantify the effects that neighbouring tumour and immune cells have on therapeutic success. In contrast to generalized and cytotoxic chemotherapies, immunotherapies aim to harness an individual’s immune system to elicit a targeted immune response and hopefully provide durable therapeutic benefits. Unfortunately, recent disappointing trial results for a variety of immunotherapies stress the need for a more tailored approach to immunotherapeutic scheduling that takes into account patient-specific heterogeneity and the potential for developing resistance. In response, quantitative approaches provide a way to test therapeutic protocols before they are used in patients, ultimately reducing bottlenecks along the drug development pipeline, rationalizing therapeutic scheduling, and improving patient outcomes. Here I will discuss two recent projects focused on establishing effective therapeutic protocols for mono- and poly-oncolytic virus treatments. Using mathematical and computational modelling, we constructed models that recapitulated realistic patient cohorts to study combined vaccinia and vesicular stomatitis oncolytic viruses, and to understand the impact of the tumour microenvironment in glioblastoma multiforme (a deadly central nervous system tumour) on oncolytic virotherapy penetration and efficacy. In both cases, we showed that therapeutic success was principally determined by tailoring treatment to underlying patient characteristics, including tumour aggressivity and spatial structure. Our results highlight the relevance of quantitative approaches to pre-clinical development and therapeutic design, and underline the impact of inter- and intra-individual variability on treatment outcomes.

The role of stromal cells in cancer evolution and treatment resistance 								  										  									  									  										  										  											  			Much work on cancer’s evolutionary dynamics is focused on the genetic mutations that characterize the different stages of cancer progression or the competition between different clones as the tumor grows and copes with different treatment options and schedules. Those evolutionary dynamics are shaped by the tumor ecosystem that, in the context of skeletal cancers, include cells such as osteoclasts, osteoblasts, macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells. Those cells perform a variety of roles in a normal bone and also have an impact on cancer. In this talk I will describe mathematical models that allow us to understand the role of those cells in the normal bone, which is a key step to uncover how they can be co-opted by a tumor and what role do they play as the tumor grows and undergoes treatment.

Longitudinal data allow for precise model fitting and parameter estimation which can be used to predict tumor behavior. However, molecular level data, although often available at few snapshots in time, is what biologists and clinicians typically use to better understand underlying disease biology in both experimental and clinical settings. While the quantitative nature of these snapshot data sets has vastly improved with technologies such as single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), there exists a need for integrating snapshot and longitudinal data into mathematical frameworks in order to develop the most informed models to describe and predict cancer progression. In this work, we integrate longitudinal drug-response data with snapshot scRNAseq data at just three times points, thus calibrating model outputs to experimental data for two distinct modes of data. We demonstrate that direct incorporation of high-resolution scRNAseq snapshot data into the parameter estimation improves the identifiability of the mathematical model and its predictive power. We present this work as an example of how mathematical oncology can develop novel workflows for incorporating the available biological data to better understand cancer treatment response.

MSCs can, however, either promote or suppress tumor growth. To address the critical question of how MSCs loaded with oncolytic viruses affect virotherapy outcomes and tumor growth patterns in a tumor microenvironment, we developed and analyzed an integrated mathematical-experimental model. We used the model to describe both the growth dynamics in our experiments of firefly luciferase-expressing Hep3B tumor xenografts and the effects of the immune response during the MSCs-based virotherapy. We further employed it to explore the conceptual clinical feasibility, particularly, in evaluating the relative significance of potential immune promotive/suppressive mechanisms induced by MSCs loaded with oncolytic viruses. We were able to delineate conditions which may significantly contribute to the success or failure of MSC-based virotherapy as well as generate new hypotheses. In fact, one of the most impactful outcomes shown by this investigation, not inferred from the experiments alone, was the initially counter-intuitive fact that using tumor-promoting MSCs as carriers is not only helpful but necessary in achieving tumor control. Considering the fact that it is still currently a controversial debate whether MSCs exert a pro- or anti-tumor action, mathematical models such as this one help to quantitatively predict the consequences of using MSCs for delivering virotherapeutic agents in vivo. Taken together, our results show that MSC-mediated systemic delivery of oncolytic viruses is a promising strategy for achieving synergistic anti-tumor efficacy with improved safety profiles.

One important class of PSDBPs are branching processes with a carrying capacity; these are appropriate for modelling populations that exhibit logistic growth, where the population size tends to fluctuate, for a long period of time, around a threshold value corresponding to the maximum number of individuals that an ecosystem can support. We propose an estimator for the mean of the o↵spring distribution at each population size in a discrete- time PSDBP, based on the observation of the total population sizes up to some generation. Our main challenge is the fact that branching processes with a carrying capacity eventually become extinct with probability one (after a long time). We propose a way to derive asymptotic properties of the estimator in this setting. This leads to a number of questions about desired properties of estimators in branching processes that almost surely become extinct.

In these processes, the population size grows logistically and lingers for a long period of time around the carrying capacity before eventually becoming extinct. We consider discrete-time branching processes with a carrying capacity and assume that the offspring distributions belong to some parametric family with unknown parameter. Based on the observation of the population sizes, we propose several estimators for the target parameters, and in particular, for the carrying capacity. Finally, we illustrate the properties of these estimators via some examples.

Our aim is to estimate the exit time of some nonlinear autoregressive processes and hereby gain insight into the problem of determining the expected life time of the corresponding size-dependent branching process. Let {Xn}, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , be a stochastic process defined by the recursion formula Xn+1 = f(Xn)+ e C n+1, X0 = 0 in Rd where f is a mapping from Rd to itself and the C’s are a sequence of i. i. d. normal random variables. e is a small nonnegative parameter. We assume that f(0) = 0 and that f is in some sense contracting so that the resulting Markov chain is positive recurrent. In the one-dimensional case we take f to be, for example, a piecewise linear function or a piecewise polynomial. The aim is to investigate, asymptotically as e goes to 0, the expected time until the process exits from the interval [-1,1]. In the case of linear autoregressive processes the asymptotics of the expected exit times was treated in Jung.

The temporal order of gene activities in return, can provide new insights into the gene regulatory networks governing cell differentiation. We adapted a dimension-reduction technique called “diffusion maps” for the analysis and reconstruction of cell differentiation trajectories. We perceived cell differentiation as a diffusion-like process, where cells are gradually and to some extent stochastically changing their gene expression profiles as they proceed to more differentiated molecular states. Thus, cell differentiation dynamics can (in discrete form) be described by: p(t) = p(t − 1) * T.  That is, the probability distribution at the position of each sampled cell at time t, p(t) is given by the probability distributions at time (t − 1) multiplied by the cells’ pairwise transition probabilities matrix T. Thus, p(t) and p(t − 1) are vectors of length N (number of cells) and T is an N by N matrix which accommodates: 1) transition probabilities which are purely based on geometrical distances between the cells, 2) directional transition probabilities towards more differentiated cell states and 3) source/sink probabilities for accounting for cell’s prolifereation/death rates. Considering purely geometrical transition probabilities, Tgeom is a row-normalised positive-definite matrix which characterises the manifold on which cell differentiation is taking place in the high-dimensional gene expression space. The complete process (i. e. , including directional and source/sink diffusion terms) thus, describes different dynamics taking place on that same manifold. Because of this resemblance to a diffusion process, we introduced an adaptation of diffusion maps for data embedding and differentiation trajectories reconstruction from single-cell data. In a simple form, data embedding by diffusion maps is given by the first eigenvectors of Tgeom corresponding to it largest eigenvalues. We extended the diffusion map’s framework to define “pseudotime” quantifying the differentiation stage of each cell based on on-manifold diffusion distances from the root (pluripotent) cell state. Fur- thermore, we showed that differentiation branching events can be identified by application of the triangle inequality to the on-manifold distances. The diffusion metrics with new approaches for inclusion of directional and source/sink probabilities (infered from biologically known differentiation terminal points, spliced/unspliced mRNA comparisons, time-lapse measurements for a few genes) has been used in several trajectory reconstruction methods on exceedingly complex manifolds which I will briefly discuss in my presentation.

Lag- ging behind are efforts to combine dynamical systems models with single-cell data. The existence of transient or intermediate cell states – corresponding to shallow attractor states on a potential landscape – further confounds the development of simple models. Here we present new approaches to address these challenges. We propose methods to infer both model structure and model parameters of cell lineage models using single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We fit model structure by assuming a core set of cell population dynamic processes, i. e. a general system described by ẋ(t) = (αf (x) − δ)x(t), where x(t) is a vector of cell states, α and δ are cell state-specific proliferation and death rates, and f (x) is a feedback function. We use methods for trajectory and cell-cell communication inference to infer lineage relationships and feedback interactions. Taking advantage of the information present in the pseudotemporal ordering of cells, we perform Bayesian parameter inference: that is we fit the model to “pseudo-dynamics” to constrain the parameters. With application to hematopoiesis, we demonstrate the ability to select between models and predict future cell differentiation dynamics. We will discuss how this model inference framework can also be applied to gene regulatory network dynamics, enabling not only the simulation of single-cell data-derived models, but also the characterization of their stable steady states and bifurcations.

High-throughput single-cell analysis has brought the dream closer. It is now possible to sample cell states in high-dimension and to map trajectories through continuous gene expression space. Using prior knowledge or measurements of RNA maturity, the general direction of cell progression along these trajectories can be inferred. Yet it remains unclear to what extent single-cell RNA-seq encodes a unique dynamical system over cell state. Here, I will discuss two key obstacles to inferring cell state dynamics from single-cell RNA seq data, and how additional types single-cell measurements might overcome them. First, applying the principle of population reveals the importance of measuring cell proliferation and death rates for accurately inferring cell dynamics. Second, clonal tracing using DNA barcoding reveals that RNA-seq alone cannot distinguish cells with different cell-autonomous fate biases, emphasizing the need to measure other variables such as chromatin state.

In this talk, I will discuss different approaches to develop mathematical models from high-dimensional single-cell data. In particular, single-cell RNA sequencing data is challenging due to its high-dimensionality, and dimension reduction techniques are essential in finding the trajectories of cell states in the reduced differentiation space. We develop models using differential equations that describe the cell differentiation as directed and random movement on the abstracted graph or on the multi-dimensional reduced space. Normal hematopoiesis differentiation and abnormal processes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression are simulated. We show that the model can predict the emergence of cells in novel intermediate states of differentiation consistent with immunophenotypic characterizations of AML, and compare the pros and cons of the models on the graph and on the multi-dimensional reduced space.

Using a stochastic branching-process model, we show that “bidirectional” tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control, reducing the effective reproduction number (Reff) by at least ~0. 3 while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. Adding smartphone-based exposure notification can further reduce Reff by 0. 25, but only if nearly all smartphones can detect exposure events. Our results suggest that with or without digital approaches, implementing bidirectional tracing will enable health agencies to control COVID-19 more effectively without requiring high-cost interventions.

This brief report evaluates the effect of travel bans imposed to prevent COVID-19 importation in the Australian context. We developed a stochastic meta-population model to capture the global dynamics and spread of COVID-19. By adjusting our model to capture the travel bans imposed globally and in Australia, the predicted COVID-19 cases imported to Australia were evaluated in comparison to observed imported cases. Our modelling results closely aligned with observed cases in Australia and elsewhere. We observed a 79% reduction in COVID-19 importation and a delay of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia by approximately one month. Further projection of COVID-19 to May 2020 showed spread patterns depending on the basic reproduction number. Imposing the travel ban was effective in delaying widespread transmission of COVID-19. However, strengthening of the domestic control measures is needed to prevent Australia from becoming another epicentre. This report has shown the importance of border closure to pandemic control.

I will discuss our previous work on influenza pandemics, and and the tools we have used to understand the temporal patterns of those outbreaks.  Applying similar tools to the COVID-19 pandemic is easier in some respects and harder in others.  I will describe our current approach to modelling the spread of COVID-19, and some of the challenges and limitations of epidemic forecasting.

This has inspired the study of optimal gaits and locomotion strategies, in particular for the case of undulatory movement of slender bodies. The primary focus has been on finding optimal waveforms for moving forwards along straight paths. However, the ability to turn and manoeuvre is also relevant to survival. We revisit this problem in the context of low Reynolds number hydrodynamics and obtain the optimal waveforms for undulators along curved trajectories. For shallow turning angles, we obtain small perturbations of a travelling wave as optimal. For larger turning angles, however, the optimal gait can be radically different, with the undulator abruptly curling and uncurling itself. We believe that these results can lend insight into the search behaviours of simple organisms, such as C. elegans, as well as be a tool for phenotyping their behaviour across mutant strains and under different environmental conditions.

These features of the problem have motivated the development of methods based on singularity distributions (Stokeslets/Oseen tensors). In recent years the methods of regularized Stokeslets has become widely used in biological fluid dynamics; this technique avoids the need for generation of a connected surface mesh, removes the need to compute singular integrals, and therefore is very convenient and accessible. This talk focuses on some algorithmic refinements to the method of regularized Stokeslets aimed at improving the efficiency of the method while retaining the convenience and accessibility of the method. We discuss (1) the use of meshless interpolation, in particular the nearest-neighbour discretisation, (2) exploitation of graphical processing unit computing to handle relatively large problems through built-in linear algebra routines in Matlab, (3) the NEAREST software package in Matlab, and benchmarking against a compiled Fortran code. The focus will be on providing practical and reliable tools for the quantitative biology of microscopic motility.

The choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta, which has a complex life cycle that includes unicellular and multicellular stages, provides a model system to study within one species the functional consequences of: 1) different cell morphologies (swimming cell with a collar of prey- capturing microvilli surrounding a single flagellum; dispersal-stage cell with a slender body, long flagellum, and short collar), 2) being free-swimming vs. sessile (thecate cell attached to a surface), and 3) being a single cell vs. a multicellular colony. For model organisms of different life stages, we use the method of regularized Stokeslets to examine the effects of different morphological features on swimming and feeding performance. We compare the model predictions with lab experiments that used high-speed microvideography to measure swimming and feeding currents produced by different life stages. We find that a longer flagellum increases swimming speed, longer microvilli reduce speed, and cell shape only affects speed when the collar is very short. The flux of prey-carrying water into the collar capture zone is greater for swimming than sessile cells, but this advantage decreases with collar size. Stalk length has little effect on flux for sessile cells.

Thus, it is important to have methods to determine the identifying and consequential features of cells. To this end, we developed scCoGAPS to learn robust feature dimensions from scRNAseq and projectR to investigate these, or other continuous valued, feature dimensions in biologically related data across technologies, omics, and species. We demonstrate how this implementation of transfer learning via dimension reduction represent a platform for in silico experimentation and hypothesis generation where knowledge from multiple data sets is leveraged for selection of meaningful feature dimensions for validation.

During EMT, cells lose their epithelial traits and acquire mesenchymal ones to varying degrees. Recent evidence has suggested that cells need not necessarily display 'pure' epithelial or mesenchymal states, but can stably acquire one or more hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) ones. In silico, in vitro and in vivo analysis indicates that these hybrid E/M states can be more aggressive and perhaps the 'fittest' for metastasis, thus identifying mechanisms enabling these hybrid E/M states is crucial for decoding tumor aggressiveness. Using an integrative approach involving mechanism-based models to identify master regulators of such hybrid E/M phenotypes, data-based models to decipher transcriptomics signatures specific to the hybrid E/M phenotypes, and experiments to test our predictions, we have identified how these hybrid E/M cell states may be maintained via cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms. Our work also highlights that the hybrid E/M specific signatures associate with worse clinicopathological traits, thus offering a mechanistic basis for its aggressiveness and pinpointing novel putative targets.

For imaging-level brain tumor growth modeling, such as the Proliferation-Invasion (PI) model and its more complex variants, the abnormality region requires an assumption for the tumor cell density. This assumption is necessary to make estimates regarding the shape of the leading edge, however the use of an assumption can be limiting. Searching across MRI images that have been simulated across the model parameter space could eliminate the need for a cell density assumption, however noisy MRIs will reduce the reliability of such a technique. Our objective is to determine if matching the noise between simulations and MRIs can increase our ability to predict model parameters based on an image's characteristics. We generated phantom brain tumors using the Proliferation-Invasion-Hypoxia-Necrosis-Angiogenesis- Edema (PIHNA-E) model. One hundred unique phantoms were created assuming 10 different rates of migration (D [mm2/year]) and 10 different rates of proliferation ( [1/year])]. PIHNA-E simulations were then passed into a MRI signal model for generating simulated T2-weighted MRIs. We created two independent runs of six sets of 100 simulated MRIs, with each set incorporating a different level noise. The first run represented simulated images with known D and or 'ground truth', while the second run represented candidate 'real-world' noisy images for which we would have not normally known D and . We then compared each noise level from the second 'real-world' run to each noise level from the first 'ground truth' run. Within each set comparison, we calculated the L2-norm of twelve statistical features for each image in the second 'real-world' set relative to the 'ground truth' set of images. The D and of the 'ground truth' image with the lowest L2-norm relative to the 'real-world' image were selected as the predicted parameters. For each noise level, a prediction rate is calculated by assessing the percentage rate that the L2-norm-based selection was correct. As expected, the prediction rates decreased overall as the image noise level increased. For 'real- world' images with limited noise, creating a similar noise level in the 'ground truth' images did enable higher prediction rates of D and . Future directions of this work include repeating these methods across additional replicates and exploring processing steps for reducing MRI noise, which could increase our prediction rate of D.

Anti-fragility is a situation where the curvature of the dose-response function is convex, mathematically defined as a positive second derivative. This positive curvature is associated with benefits from increased variance or unevenness of a treatment schedule. For example, if the curvature is positive near a dose of ‘x’, continuous administration of x may have a less efficacious response compared to a regimen that switches equally between 120% of x and 80% of x, even though both regimens use the same total drug. Although dose-response data is readily available, such second-order effects are typically ignored. Nonlinear sigmoidal dose-response curves are ubiquitous in medicine and have both convex and concave regions. Selection pressure due to treatment selects for resistant phenotypes over time. In response, the magnitude of dose response curvature and the  convex-concave inflection point both decrease in value. The key insight is that dose-response convexity ('anti-fragility') decreases in proportion to the amount of resistance in the tumor population. This provides a time-dependent metric which 1) predicts the emergence of resistance and 2) determines the optimal subsequent dosing strategy.  We demonstrate this paradigm using a Hill function model parameterized by in vitro experimental data of H3122 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines confronted to 10 different drugs. Through this dataset, we present antifragility applied to 1) treatment resistance, 2) collateral sensitivity, and 3) combination therapy.

The cancer originates from a small population of so called leukemia stem cells (LSC) that survive treatment and trigger re- lapse. During the course of the disease leukemic cells accumulate in the bone marrow and impair healthy blood cell formation. The impact of this interaction on the clinical course of the disease remains not well understood. We develop and validate a mathematical model of stem cell competition in the human hematopoietic stem cell niche. Model simulations predict how processes in the stem cell niche affect the speed of disease progression. Combining the mathematical model with data of individual patients, we quantify the selective pressure LSC exert on HSC and demonstrate model's prognostic significance. We develop a novel model-based risk-stratification approach. This approach allows extracting prognostic information from counts of healthy and malignant cells at the time of diagnosis. We demonstrate its feasibility based on a cohort of ALDH-rare AML patients and show that the model-based risk strati- fication is an independent predictor of disease free and overall survival. This proof of concept study shows how model-based interpretation of patient data can improve prognostic scoring and contribute to personalization of treatment. The talk is based on joint works with Thomas Stiehl (Institute of Applied Mathematics, Heidelberg University), Wenwen Wang and Christoph Lutz (Heidelberg Medical Clinic).

Although, regime shifts leading to algal blooms are quite well known in aquatic ecosystems, the effect of contamination on such regime shift is not particularly well understood. Motivated by this, we studied the effect of copper enrichment on planktonic system using a minimal phytoplankton-zooplankton model. Interestingly, our results suggest that both the toxic and deficient concentration of copper in water bodies can lead to catastrophic transition of the ecosystem to an alternative stable state. Further, on adding stochasticity to the system the region of bistability is diminished and the system switches from zooplankton dominated state to the phytoplankton dominated state much prior to the tipping point. The bistability is further weakened on increasing noise intensity and redness. However, in case of systems with high nutrient enrichment, the bimodality in the probability density can be very prominent. Nevertheless, generic early warning signals may fails to predict an impending state shift due to contamination. Our study provides important perspective to regime shifts in the context of eco-toxicology.

These long transients tantalizingly appear to replicate dynamics seen in real systems-with one critical difference: ecological data is noisy, a reality theoretical work often ignores. In general, stochasticity is known to have important consequences: it can qualitatively alter model dynamics as well as impact our ability to infer underlying processes through statistical analysis. To explore the effect of stochasticity on qualitative model behavior and the implications for our ability to infer underlying mechanisms, we generated time series from a simple model of long transient behavior with additive noise. We then examined if noise qualitatively changes the expected dynamics of the system and how well phenomenological and mechanistic statistical models could recover the underlying model. We found that long transients such as those generated by even the simplest stochastic model of a ghost attractor are highly sensitive to noise, and that the mean behavior of the stochastic model differs substantially from that of the deterministic model. In spite of this, we illustrate that statistical inference on a single realization may still provide insight into model parameters, and highlight that inference improves for an increasing number of realizations of the process. All approaches saw improved results with increasing data realizations. We suggest methods to increase our ability to draw inference from real ecological time series with suspected long transient dynamics.

Here, we will consider autonomous models for which E(t, X(t)) ≡ E(X(t)) non-negative of class C1. The usual density-dependence case with f strictly decreasing and f(+∞) &lt; 0 was studied in [1] w. r. t. conditions for population extinction or for existence of a stationary density. In [5, 6], for the particular cases of f being logistic or Gompertz, profit optimization was studied comparing variable effort E(t, X(t)) fishing policies with constant effort E(t, X(t)) ≡ E policies. Sometimes, however, the population under fishing is affected by Allee effects, with an unexpected depression (accompanied by growth) of f(x) for small values of x, due, for instance, to the difficulty of finding mating partners or of putting together an effective collective defence from predators. [4] made a comparative study between variable and constant effort policies for the particular case of f being logistic-like with Allee effects. In [2, 3], for populations not subjected to fishing and for general growth models f with Allee effects, conditions for extinction or for existence of a stationary density were studied. We are now generalizing this study, under appopriate conditions, to fished populations with general growth models f(·) with Allee effects and with also general autonomous harvesting efforts E(·). Again, we found out that the deciding factor between extinction or existence of a stationary density is the sign, when the population size is small, of the net (i. e. , discounting the mortality rate due to fishing) geometric average per capita growth rate. The cases previously studied, as well as the gear saturation phenomenon, can be treated as particular cases.

However, while previous studies have shown how trait variation can alter the overall amplitude of the predator-prey oscillations, this altered amplitude remained constant over time. This strongly contrasts with empirically observed predator-prey dynamics and recent theoretical work, showing that several mechanisms may lead to so called intermittent predator- prey cycles where the amplitude of the predator-prey dynamics varies temporally. For instance, trait differences that determine the functional responses of two predators may provoke temporal fluctuations in the amplitudes of the predator-prey cycles due to recurrent changes in the relative abundance of the two predator types: a predator with a relatively linear functional response promotes small-amplitude oscillations whereas a predator with a more strongly non-linear functional response stimulates larger amplitudes. We analysed various models that incorporate trait variation within prey, predators, or both, and identified three general conditions that are necessary for intermittent cycles to occur. First, the predator-prey system comprises at least two subsystems that exhibit substantial differences in the amplitude of their population dynamics and thus tendency to promote stable or unstable population dynamics. Second, these subsystems recurrently alternate in their dominance, leading to a second “trait” cycle superimposed on the population dynamics. Finally, the time scale of the trait dynamics must be significantly slower than that of the population dynamics. For instance, co-evolution may promote intermittent cycles in predator-prey dynamics by inducing a lag in the predators’ trait adjustment in response to altered trait values of the prey. The resulting temporal variation in the interaction strength between predator and prey is associated with temporal changes in the amplitudes of the population dynamics since e. g. , a dominance of defended prey dampens the population dynamics whereas a high abundance of undefended prey enhances it. Our results highlight that intermittent cycles may frequently occur in simple predator-prey systems allowing for trait variation.

The principal process that allows microvascular network remodeling and adaptation is angiogenesis. Angiogenesis begins when hypoxia or lack of nutrients triggers the release of a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is typically VEGFA. The VEGF forms a gradient, and when the concentration of VEGF reaches a threshold around a segment of the blood vessel, it causes the segment to destabilize and to lose its mural cells. During the subsequent stage of sprouting angiogenesis, some of the ECs become tip cells that extend filipodia and migrate following the VEGF gradient. The ECs adjacent to the tip cells become stalk cells that elongate, proliferate, and trail the tip cell. Once the tip cell reaches another tip cell or blood vessel segment, an anastomosis forms establishing a new connection in the microvascular network. During anastomosis formation macrophages act as chaperones for the tip cell. Additionally, macrophages phagocytize the ECs that undergo apoptosis during microvascular pruning. Definitive hematopoiesis occurs first during early embryogenesis when a group of endothelial cells undergo the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) and become hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Some of the HSCs become granulocyte monocyte precursor cells (GMPs). Certain GMPs differentiate into monocytes, and macrophages differentiate from monocytes.  In adult humans, ECs retain the capability to undergo EHT and we aim to study the potential of ECs to differentiate into macrophages and to elucidate the extracellular microenvironmental conditions that promote EC-to-macrophage differentiation. Our approach is to first assemble a molecular regulatory network based on the information available in the literature about the main molecules involved in the regulation of the process and the interactions between them. Then we will transform the model into a dynamic system in the form of a Boolean Network. Then, we simulate and analyze the dynamic behavior of the model. Afterward, we will validate the model by comparing the observed effect of the available relevant mutations with their simulated effect.

In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages new types of lineage-tracing information measured simultaneously with gene expression. These experimental techniques use heritable CRISPR-induced genetic barcodes to trace the history of cell divisions over the course of development. Crucially, these barcodes can be measured in the same cells as gene expression. Our method, designed for lineage-tracing time courses, learns from both kinds of information together using mathematical tools from graphical models, structural equation models, and optimal transport. We find that lineage data improves optimal transport’s effectiveness in disentangling complex state transitions with lower temporal resolution, thereby reducing experimental cost.

Boolean networks are intuitive, simple to describe, and yield qualitative results even when data is limited. This talk will outline a research program aimed at harnessing the collective knowledge contained in hundreds of diverse Boolean GRN models in order to understand the impact of network structure and topology on network dynamics and stability, and in particular the role of canalization in gene regulation. The biological term canalization reflects a cell’s ability to maintain a stable phenotype despite ongoing environmental perturbations. Accordingly, Boolean canalizing functions are functions where the output is already determined if a certain, canalizing variable takes on its canalizing input, regardless of all other inputs. Using text- and data-mining techniques and the PubMed search engine, we generated an expandable database of published, expert-curated Boolean GRN models, and extracted more than 5, 000 rules governing these networks. A meta-analysis of all these rules confirmed a strong overrepresentation of certain types of canalizing functions. We also studied the abundance of small structures within the networks, called network motifs, and found significant differences between published GRNs but also when comparing to random networks. Furthermore, we analyzed the dynamical robustness of GRNs and found most of them to operate at a “critical threshold” between order and chaos. These findings highlight how our continuously-expanding database provides a versatile tool to identify the overarching design principles underlying gene regulation.

The treatment of infective individuals is a signficant method to reduce infection risk and control the spreads of infectious diseases. In this work, we propose an SIR multi-group epidemic model with the awareness of susceptible population and saturated treatment function, which describes the effects of the availability of medical resources for treatment. We assume that treatment of the infected individuals of a group is affected by the medical resources for the treatment of each group. The basic reproduction number R0 is computed. The local and global stability of equilibrium has been determined in the term of R0 and availability of medical resources for treatment. The occurrence of backward bifurcation have been discussed at R0 = 1 and the existence of multiple endemic equilibria when R0 &lt; 1: The global stability of unique endemic equilibrium has been showed with help of some graph-theoretic techniques when R0 &gt; 1: Finally, numerical simulations of the system are also presented in various cases to support and counterpart the obtained theoretical results. We discussed the impacts of the awareness of the susceptible population and the availability of medical resources for treatment in every group on the epidemic size of each group.

We build a model of sublethal disease effects where hosts are able to choose to engage in prophylactic measures that reduce the likelihood of disease transmission (e. g. , hand washing, social distancing). This choice is mediated by utility costs and benefits associated with prophylaxis, and the fraction of hosts engaged in prophylaxis is also affected by population dynamics. When prophylactic host behaviour occurs, we find that the level of pathogen host exploitation is reduced, by the action of selection, relative to the level that would otherwise be predicted in the absence of prophylaxis. Our work emphasizes the significance of the transmission-recovery trade-off faced by the pathogen and the ability of the pathogen to influence host prophylactic behaviour.

The property of unique estimates for a given output trajectory is called structural identifiability: a system is globally (resp. locally) structurally identifiable if the map from parameters to output trajectories is injective (resp. has finite fibers). Identifiability is especially important for infectious diesease models, since the parameter estimates are used for generating predictions and comparing outbreak intervention strategies. In this paper, we apply differential algebra techniques to study the structural identifiability of multistage infectious disease models (generalizations of the $SEIR$ model with multiple $I$ stages). We prove that these models are not structurally identifiable from incidence data, and we determine the rational functions of parameters that can be estimated from incidence data, called identifiable combinations, for the case where each $I$ stage has equal duration. We conjecture the identifiable combinations of the general model; we provide computational evidence for the conjecture and verify it for models with 2 infectious stages.

SDTFs are central effectors for inflammatory gene expression, and hence they serve a critical role in immune system. The information contained in SDTF signals must also be decoded by the epigenome to allow controlled plasticity in cellular epigenetic states in response to environmental encounters. The mechanisms and biophysical principles that generate distinct epigenomes in response to different SDTF signaling remain unclear. Here, we develop and analyze stochastic models of nucleosome accessibility to study how SDTF signals alter the epigenome dynamics. Interestingly the response of our epigenome model to SDTF signals helps us to predict the system parameters of genome-scale nucleosome in vivo. On the genome-scale, the relation between the SDTF binding location and nucleosome accessibility plays a role of a parameter predictor since the epigenome dynamics depends on SDTF binding sites differently under various parameter regimes. We could compare our numerical results to experimental measurements to test our prediction. Our work proposes a systematic framework that allows a predictive understanding in vivo nucleosome accessibility.

Src kinases, which have many functions in cell biology, are known to undergo autophosphorylation in trans. This means that the phosphorylation of a site on the kinase is catalysed by another molecule of the same enzyme. This type of phosphorylation can lead to new phenomena. The usual model of the phosphorylation of a protein on a single site is known to admit only one steady state. In the work reported on here it is proved that in the case of a site which is subject to autophosphorylation there can be more than one stable steady state. Thus a substance of this type can serve as a switch. Src kinases such as Lck, which is involved in many processes in lymphocytes, have two tyrosine phosphorylation sites but a form of Lck in which one of these sites (Y394) has been knocked out has been studied experimentally. It represents a known substance to which the model we have studied is applicable. This work is intended as a step towards a better understanding of the regulation of the activation of Lck, and thus of the function of lymphocytes. This type of insight has the potential to improve cancer immunotherapy.

In 2006, Armstrong, Painter and Sherratt introduced a non-local PDE model for cellular adhesion, which was able to describe known experimental results on cell sorting and cancer growth. Since then, this model has been the focus of applications and analysis. The analysis becomes challenging through non-local cell-cell interaction and interactions with boundaries. In this talk I will present theoretical results of the adhesion model, such as a random walk derivation, biologically realistic boundary conditions, pattern formation and results on local and global existence of solutions.

This constitutes a versatile tool, where various imaging modalities can reveal the dynamics of tumour progression, and novel drug targets can be investigated. However, this research occurs at expense of animal su ering. With the advent of high-performance computing and increasing knowledge of cellular and physiological processes the opportunity arises to replace in vivo mouse models with computational models that describe the growth of the tumour and its interactions with the host animal. We have developed a computational model of glioblastoma, a malignant form of brain tumour, which utilises data from Di usion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to represent anatomical structures within the model. The model takes into account a DTI-map obtained from adult normal mouse brains. The corresponding di usion tensor encodes information about nerve bre direction and density, and is therefore assumed to in uence cancer cell migration. In contrast to previous DTI-models we consider a cell-based model, where each cancer cell resides within a voxel (of volume 40 x 40 x 40 m3), which, due to volumetric constraints can contain a maximum of K cells. If the local density is below K each cell divides with at a rate α placing the daughter cell in the same voxel. Cell migration occurs with a rate Davg, which is the average value of the diffusion tensor, into one of the 6 neighbouring voxels, where the probability of moving to each neighbouring cell depends on the di usion tensor. A parameter, which ranges from 0 to 1, controls the impact of the di usion tensor, such that q = 0 corresponds to random migration and cells ignoring the anatomical structure, whereas q = 1 results in cells always moving along the direction of largest di usion (i. e. along bres). Simulations are initiated with 10,000 cells at the site of injection and contain approximately 1 million cells upon termination. Our results show that the model can recapitulate both nodal and di use tumours seen in the mouse model depending on the model parameters. Currently we are estimating model parameters from xenograft tumours obtained from di erent patients with the aim of identifying patient-speci c di erences, which, in the future, could inform personalised treatments.

Cell-autonomous effects such as genetic instability and non-cell-autonomous effects such as cancer therapies and their ability to induce resistance and the local cellular composition of the surrounding microenvironment are key elements promoting high levels of clonal heterogeneity in these evolving ecosystems. To understand the effects such features have on the prevalence of resistance at diagnosis and to predict the impact two-drug treatment protocols have on the level of resistance within the tumour during treatment, we have developed a stochastic Lotka-Volterra model of tumour growth incorporating four cell populations with varying levels of resistance to two drugs. The model incorporates both spontaneous and drug-induced resistance via mutations and employs population-dependent birth rates derived from a recent game-theory study to account for the effects of cellular interactions. The effect of the fitness of drug-resistant cells relative to drug-sensitive cells is also considered by incorporating both advantageous and deleterious mutation cases. We calculated the proportion of resistance in a tumour at diagnosis. The proportion of resistance is an increasing function of the mutation probability and cell turnover ratio with significantly larger proportions when mutations are advantageous as opposed to deleterious. At diagnosis, we introduced four treatment protocols applying either two TKIs with inhibitory effects or two cytotoxic drugs and observed the proportion of resistance in the tumour once it had reached a clinically relevant size. Our model demonstrates the relative fitness of drug-resistant cells to drug-sensitive cells, the ability for the drugs to induce resistance and sequential application of two TKIs results in a notable difference in the level of resistance in the tumour during treatment as opposed to when the drugs are applied simultaneously. These estimates of the size of the drug-resistant tumour cell population prior to and during two-drug treatment protocols can inform treatment strategies when combining two TKIs.

Development of more effective treatments is hindered by gaps in our understanding of CRC initiation and evolution, as well as the limitations of in vitro and in vivo experimental techniques. Specifically, in CRC we don’t fully understand the role of initiation mutations on the subsequent evolution of the disease, making it unique to each patient and therefore limiting the efficacy of general treatments. To bridge this gap in our knowledge, we use computational techniques such as agent-based modelling, gene regulatory network and continuous mathematical techniques to integrate molecular and cellular scale information to explain tumour growth and evolution. One of the biggest challenges we face is that collecting biological data is not enough. We need to figure out which are the right methods to analyse and utilise the data. Specially in cancer research, there is an abundance of data in many scales, from molecular and cellular to epidemiological; but without the right tools, such as multi-scale models, most of it remains under-utilised. To tackle CRC initiation, where colon epithelium loses its homeostasis, it was important to first have a clear understanding of the normal case. We constructed a cell-based model of a healthy colon crypt, incorporating different biological data and choosing the appropriate modelling abstraction for each one. We decided that agent-based modelling would provide us with the emergent property of homeostasis, common throughout biology. Through the interaction of the elements, cells in this case, a global balance arises which was not programmed into the equation and which was then validated by biological data. We extended this model with gene-regulatory network techniques to create an in silico experimental environment in which the effects of oncogenic mutations can be investigated and analysed with unique granularity. We further incorporated molecular data within the agent-based model to suggest novel therapies that consider not only the tumour, but the complex cross-talk between cancer and the rest of the healthy colon. We are currently working on incorporating data from the impact of current treatments, with the goal of tailoring it to individual patients to help control their specific disease and prolong their life. We envision for multi-scale models in the computational sciences to enable a greater understanding of the dynamics and evolution of diseases such as CRC, helping us explore, understand and harness the complex biological landscape, as well as supporting the development of new clinical prevention and treatment interventions. Further, these techniques can be readily deployed in hospitals, and some of them have already, as an aid for the clinician to help make better decisions, minimise costs and maximise the patients’ quality of life.

At the same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has highlighted their limitations.  If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot be determined from out-put measurements, its ability to yield correct insights – as well as the possibility of controlling the system – maybe compromised.  Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many variations of such models have been used for analysing and predicting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In this paper we survey the different models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and assessing their ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem using the control theoretic concepts of structural identifiability and observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic, we consider boththe constant and time-varying parameter assumptions.  We analyse the structural identifiability and observability ofall of the models, considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which leads us to analyse 255 different model versions. We classify the models according to their structural identifiability and observability under the different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also illustrate with an example several alternative ways of remedying the lack of observability of a model. Our analyses provide guidelines for choosing the most informative model for each purpose, taking into account the available knowledge and measurements.

While biochemical models of adaptation have been previously proposed, here we discuss a different mechanism based on mechanosensing, where the interaction between biochemical signaling and cell tension facilitates adaptation. In this talk, we develop and analyze a model of mechanochemical-based adaptation consisting of a mechanics-based physical model coupled with the wave-pinning reaction-diffusion model for Rac GTPase activity. We use Local Perturbation Analysis to predict how cells adapt signaling parameters via feedback from mechanics to maintain polarity in response to chemoattractant levels. To confirm this prediction, we simulate the mechanochemical model in moving cells, demonstrating how mechanosensing results in persistent cell polarity when cells are stimulated with wide-ranging levels of chemoattractant in silico. These results demonstrate how mechanosensing may help cells adapt to maintain polarity in variable environments.

The lengths of its two flagella are tightly regulated. We study a model of flagellar length control whose key assumption is that proteins responsible for the intraflagellar transport (IFT) of tubulin are present in limiting amounts. In the case of two simultaneously assembling flagella, regardless of the details of how the flagella are coupled, we find that the widely-used assumption of a constant disassembly rate is inconsistent with experimental results. We therefore propose a model in which diffusion gives rise to a length-dependent concentration of depolymerizer at the flagellar tip. This model is found to be consistent with experimental results and generalizes to other situations such as arbitrary flagellar number.

Several factors play a potentially important role: 1) demographic and environmental stochasticity, 2) Allee effects, i. e. a reduction in the per-capita growth rate in small populations, for example due to mate-finding difficulties, and 3) propagule size, i. e. the initial number of individuals. It is known that both Allee effects and environmental stochasticity affect the relationship between propagule size and persistence probability in specific ways. Here I propose a new approach for the joint inference of the contributions of these two factors. The approach is based on a Markov chain model for population size with environmental stochasticity and Allee effects. The models without Allee effects or without environmental stochasticity are special cases of the general model. Given a data set for the persistence or extinction of populations of various sizes, the model parameters are estimated using a maximum-likelihood approach and then model choice is performed based on Akaike's information criterion. Using simulation studies, I explore the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Finally, I apply the approach to published data sets on experimental introductions in the field or laboratory.

Such predictions are performed using surveillance data and models grounded on partial differential equations (PDE), which form a framework often exploited to design invasion models. The framework allows the construction of phenomenological but concise models relying on mechanistic hypotheses. However, this may lead to models with overly rigid behaviour, in particular for describing phenomena in population biology. Hence, to avoid drawing a prediction relying on a single PDE-based model that would be prone to errors because of potential data-model mismatch, we propose to apply Bayesian model-averaging (BMA) for handling parameter and model uncertainties. Hence, we combine several competing spatio-temporal models of propagation for inferring parameters and drawing a consensual prediction of certain quantities of interest. This study is applied (i) to date and localize the invasion of Xylella fastidiosa, bacterium detected in Southern Corsica in 2015, France using post-introduction data, and (ii) to predict its future extent.

Predicting coexistence in heterogeneous environments where populations are linked by dispersal is a challenge that has attracted attention of ecologists. A particular body of theory, based on Lotka-Volterra-like equations, has focused on the effects of different relative dispersal rates in the absence of other differences in competing species, and has predicted that the slower disperser always outcompetes the faster one in environments where the limiting resources are heterogeneously distributed. However, this theory has never been rigorously tested empirically, and has generally only considered random diffusion. Here, we extended previous theory to include exploitable resources and an additional component of directed movement, proving qualitatively novel results, which we tested experimentally using laboratory populations of C. elegans. We revealed, both theoretically and emperically, that stable coexistence can occur when two competing species have identical directed components but different diffusive components to their movement. Our results advance understanding of coexistence theory and has important ecological implications, such as the essential of individuals obtaining clues of neighboring environments, to determine where to disperse in changing environments.

Trophic (consumer-resource) interactions, which comprise the fundamental units (modules) of food webs, are of particular importance because they have an intrinsic tendency to fluctuate in abundance, thus running to risk of stochastic extinction during periods of low abundances. Here I present a mathematical framework for predicting warming effects on consumer-resource interactions.  This work differs from previous theory in two important ways. First, it uses delay differential equations to realistically depict the developmental delays inherent in ectotherm life cycles, and incorporates mechanistic descriptions of phenotypic trait responses, derived from first principles of thermodynamics, into the dynamical delay model. Second, it investigates the recent IPCC predictions on the increase in the number of hotter-than-average days. I report three key results. First, across latitudes (tropical vs. temperate) and feeding strategies (juvenile vs. adult attacked), a greater increase in the maximum temperature compared to the minimum (hotter-than-average summers) is more detrimental to consumer-resource interactions than a greater increase in the minimum temperature (warmer-than-average winters).  Second, across latitude and warming scenarios, effects of warming are more detrimental when the consumer attacks the adult stage of the resource.  Third, across warming scenarios and feeding strategies, consumer-resource interactions in the tropics are more at risk of species losses due to warming while those in the temperate zone are more at risk of extreme fluctuations in species' abundances. I discuss implications of these results for biodiversity and biological pest control.

Cell and developmental biology has long proven a fertile ground for mathematical modelling and, with recent advances in microscopy, image analysis, and fluorescent reporter methods, it is becoming an increasingly quantitative discipline. We are now able to constrain mathematical models of developmental processes, for example through parameter estimation, increasing the potential of such models to be used in a predictive way. The objective of this Subgroup is to accelerate these efforts, by supporting and advancing the use of mathematical modelling as part of the ‘toolkit’ of cell and developmental biology.

In the brain, levels of acetylcholine change with activity. For example, acetylcholine is higher during waking and REM sleep and low during slow wave sleep.  In this talk we show how the M-current affects the bifurcation structure of a generic conductance-based neural model and how this determines synchronization properties of the model. We then use phase-model analysis to study the effect of a slowly varying M-current on synchronization. This is joint work with Victoria Booth, Xueying Wang and Isam Al-Darbasah.

The emergence of patterns generated by interactions of diffusing proteins is a paradigmatic example for self-organization. We will discuss quantitative models for intracellular Min protein patterns in E. coli, Cdc42 polarization in S. cerevisiae, and the bipolar PAR protein patterns found in C. elegans. By analyzing the molecular processes driving these systems we will show how to derive a theoretical perspective on general principles underlying self-organized pattern formation of proteins in cells. 									  											  									  									  									  								  								  								  	Veronica Grieneisen								  	 								  		Cardiff University								  									  									  										  			&lt;/br&gt; Self-organization through the mesoscale, lessons from plant patterning and adaptive responses 								  										  									  									  										  										  											  			This core ability of a cell to polarize in isolation from others then leads to the collective emergence of tissue polarity, which will be dependent on the mode of cell-cell interaction. In plants, such tissue polarity will allow for information flow over large distances, be it to guide development or to interface the environment, such as in plant-nutrient uptake. We will show how for such organism-level coordination of signals, sub-cellular components turn out to be extremely important. Also, we will discuss temporal-spatial dynamical constraints operating on such polarized tissues which are likely to have a evolutionary-developmental role in the systems we encounter in nature.

Exploring their dynamics shows that simple circuits are able to generate a plethora of diverse cellular patterns. Firstly, I will discuss how we can explore the potential for break-of-symmetry within cells. I will then explore, how through modelling we can better understand the feedbacks between these patterns and biophysical triggers that cause cell shape changes. Finally, I will show how polarity formation can also be used as an integrator for sensing external cues, and discuss how alterations of this could cause tissue-level disruption. To extend these insights directly to experimental data, I will then show how our modelling framework can also be used for segmentation of imaging data, showing examples that range from complex epithelia to organoids. 									  											  									  									  									  								  								  								  	Padmini Rangamani								  	 								  		University of California at San Diego								  									  									  										  			&lt;/br&gt; Stability analysis of a bulk-surface model for membrane-protein clustering 								  										  									  									  										  										  											  			Protein aggregation on the plasma membrane (PM) is of critical importance on many cellular processes such as cell adhesion, endocytosis, fibrillar conformation, and vesicle transport. Lateral diffusion of protein aggregates or clusters on the surface of the PM plays an important role in governing their heterogeneous surface distribution. However, the stability behavior of the surface distribution of protein aggregates remains poorly understood. Therefore, understanding the spatial patterns that can emerge on the PM uniquely through protein-protein interaction and diffusion is an important step towards a more complete description of the mechanisms behind protein clustering on the cell surface. In this work, we investigate the pattern formation of a reaction-diffusion model that describes the dynamics of a system of ligand-receptor complexes. The purely diffusive ligand in the cytosol can bind receptors in the PM and the resultant ligand-receptor complexes not only diffuse laterally but can also form clusters resulting in different oligomers. From a methodological viewpoint, we provide theoretical estimates for diffusion-driven instabilities of the protein aggregates based on the Turing mechanism. We also obtain the distribution of the size of the protein aggregates and their spatial locations depending on both initial conditions and kinetic parameters using computational methods. Our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity emerges only when the cluster diffusion rates decay as a function of cluster size.

Neutralizing antibodies elicited through prior infection or vaccination play an irreplaceable role in protection from subsequent infection. The efficacy of antibody-dependent vaccines relies on both virus replication and neutralisation, but their quantitative relationship was unknown. Here we use mathematical models to quantitatively investigate viral survivability determined by antibody concentration and inocula size. We performed focus reduction assays for 49 seasonal influenza A/H3N2 viruses circulating during 2017–2019 against influenza antisera raised in ferrets, and find that the antibody consumption rates of individual reactions were either small or large, and this was strongly positively correlated with virus saturation. Regardless of antibody consumption rate, virus-antibody interactions always lead to antibody-induced bistable viral kinetics. As a result, at a specific interval of antibody concentration, small viral inocula are eliminated but not large virus inocula, which is triggered by saturated virus neutralization or antibody consumption. Our finding highlights virus-antibody interaction with different antigenic properties, thereby explaining commonly observed influenza re-infection and enhancing vaccine efficiency.

Only a small proportion of infected individuals develop clinical disease, and factors determining why some individuals remain asymptomatic and some become sick remain unknown. Unfortunately, understanding disease progression in humans remains challenging because most people do not know they are infected. Instead, several different animal species such as mice and monkeys can be infected with Mtb, thus, providing potential explanations for progression of humans to TB. Several recent studies provided interesting insights into early Mtb dynamics in monkeys. In particular, it was found that infection of monkeys with a set of individually barcoded Mtb strains resulted in most local foci of infection (called granulomas) to contain a single barcode. This suggested that individual granulomas were started by a single bacterium. We used stochastic mathematical models to understand whether this observation is also consistent with the hypothesis that multiple strains cause granuloma formation but most die during early dynamics. Our model included the simplest possible way to describe early stochastic dynamics (linear birth-death model); interestingly, we could not find one set of model parameters that allowed us to accurately describe both mean number of bacteria per granuloma and distribution of founder strains in different granulomas. This suggests early Mtb dynamics in monkeys are unlikely to be described by a simple birth-death model, and other biological aspects must be included in the model, in particular, impact of the immune response on rates of Mtb replication and death.

A better understanding of the role of different blood constituents during infection is necessary. Mathematical analysis of data can help us to better understand the link between blood properties and the influenza virus. Furthermore, the measurement of influenza viral load in a person is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, it is crucial to have a reliable and fast method to determine the viral load in a patient. Here, we analyze blood data from mice and explore the different correlations between the key players during an infection. We test successfully a novel approach to use deep learning to infer viral load from this blood data. Hence, the viral load is directly inferred from a blood test. Using a simple multilayer perceptron, we train the algorithm with a comparatively small data set, to map blood data to the viral load. This shows the general possibility to use blood constituents measured in every routine blood count (like lymphocytes and erythrocytes) to infer the viral load in the body. Even with high variability in the data, the model prediction is reasonably accurate. Our results may lead the way to allow the measurement of the viral load from already collected blood data in the future. Hence, it would not only reduce the workload but be probably also faster. Lastly, our results suggest that platelets and granulocytes play an essential role during influenza infection.

Interruption of ART causes recrudescence of HIV plasma viremia due to the reactivation of latently HIV-infected cells, generally within weeks of discontinuation of ART. Here we characterize the timing of both the initial and subsequent successful viral reactivations following ART interruption in macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We compare these to previous results from human patients infected with HIV. We find that on average the time until the first successful viral reactivation event is longer than the time between subsequent successful reactivations. Based on this result, we hypothesise that the reactivation frequency of both HIV and SIV may fluctuate over time and that this may have implications for treatment of HIV. We develop a stochastic model to simulate the behaviour of viral reactivation following ART interruption that incorporates fluctuations in the frequency of reactivation. Our model is able to explain the difference in timing between the initial and subsequent successful reactivation events. Furthermore, we show that one of the impacts of a fluctuating reactivation frequency would be to significantly reduce the efficacy of “anti-latency” interventions for HIV that aim to reduce the frequency of reactivation. It is therefore essential to consider the possibility of a fluctuating reactivation frequency when assessing the impact of such intervention strategies.

To optimize the search for rare targets it has been proposed that T cells might perform a random walk with long displacements called Levy walks enabling superdiffusive behavior and shorter search times. Many agents ranging from molecules to large animals have been found to perform Levy walks suggesting that Levy walk-based search may be evolutionary selected. However, whether random walk patterns are driven by agent-intrinsic programs or being shaped by environmental factors remains largely unknown. We examined the behavior of activated CD8 T cells in the liver where both the movement of the cells and the underlying structural constrains can be clearly defined. We show that Plasmodium-specific liver-localized CD8 T cells perform Brownian, short displacement walks and yet display superdiffusive overall displacement, the cardinal feature of efficient Levy walks. Because liver-localized CD8 T cells are mainly associated with liver sinusoids, we show that linear structure of the sinusoids is sufficient to cause T cells to superdiffuse even when movement lengths are Brownian. Simulations of Brownian or Levy walkers in structures derived from the liver sinusoids illustrate that structure alone can enforce superdiffusive movement. Moreover, Brownian walkers require less time and thus are more efficient than Levy walkers at finding a rare target when T cells search for the infection in physiologically-derived liver structures. Importantly, analysis of fibroblastic reticular cell networks on which CD8 T cells move in lymph nodes also allows for superdiffusion in simulations which is not observed experimentally suggesting that structure is not the only factor determining movement patterns of T cells. Our results strongly suggest that observed patterns of movement of CD8 T cells are likely to result as a combination of a cell-intrinsic movement program, physical constrains imposed by the environmental structures, and other environmental cues. Future work needs to focus on quantifying relative contributions of these factors to the overall observed movement patterns of agents.

In order to control these infections, an intracellular bacterium called Wolbachia has been introduced into wild-type mosquito populations in the hopes of replacing the vector transmitting agent, Aedes aegypti with one that is incapable of transmission. In this study, we developed a Wolbachia transmission model for the novel wAu strain which possesses several favourable traits (e. g. , enhanced viral blockage and maintenance at higher temperature) but not cyctoplasmic incompatibility (CI) - when a Wolbachia-infected male mosquito mates with an uninfected female mosquito, producing no viable offspring. This model describes the competitive dynamics between wAu-Wolbachia-infected and uninfected mosquitoes and the role of imperfect maternal transmission. By analysing the system via computing the basic reproduction number(s) and stability properties, the potential of the wAu strain as a viable strategy to control arboviral infections is established. The results of this work show that enhanced maintenance of Wolbachia infection at higher temperatures can overcome the lack of CI induction to support wAu-Wolbachia infected mosquito invasion. This study will support future arboviral control programs, that rely on the introduction of new Wolbachia variants.

Theoretical models can be used to predict the time to extinction under specific interventions. In general, this question requires the use of stochastic models which recognise the inherent individual-based, chance-driven nature of the dynamics; yet stochastic models are inherently computationally expensive, especially when considering parameter uncertainty. On the other side, deterministic models are practical and tractable, however, the endpoint of an infection is by definition ambiguous in these models since the populations are represented by continuous variables that never reach zero. We study the extinction problem in deterministic models with the help of an effective ``birth-death'' description of infection and recovery processes. We present a practical method to estimate the distribution, and therefore robust means and prediction intervals, of extinction times by calculating their different moments within the birth-death framework. We compare these predictions with the solutions of the corresponding forward Kolmogorov equations. We then extend this framework to estimate the extinction time of more complex and realistic infection dynamics, African sleeping sickness, gHAT, which is a vector-borne disease transmitted to humans by tsetse. This method will enable us to improve predictions of the timing of elimination of transmission for gHAT using our existing deterministic framework.

In order to explore the spatiotemporal spread of ASF in China, we reconstructed possible ASF transmission networks using nearest neighbour, exponential function, equal probability, and spatiotemporal case-distribution algorithms. From these networks we estimated the reproduction numbers, serial intervals, and transmission distances of the outbreak. The mean serial interval between paired units was around days for all algorithms, while the mean transmission distance ranged from 332–456 kilometers. The reproduction numbers for each algorithm peaked during the first two weeks and steadily declined through the end of 2018 before hovering around the epidemic threshold value of one with sporadic increases during 2019. These results suggest that: 1) swine husbandry practices and production systems that lend themselves to long-range transmission drove ASF spread, and 2) outbreaks went undetected by the surveillance system. China and other affected countries have stepped up efforts to control ASF within their jurisdictions, and continued support for strict implementation of biosecurity standards and improvements to ASF surveillance are essential for halting transmission in China and further spread across Asia.

However, most diseases have an intra-host quiescent stage defined sometimes as covert infection (malaria for example), while other parasites have dormant stages in the environment. The influence of these two life-history traits seems to be neglected by mathematicians when developing their models [1]. In this research, we develop a coevolutionary model similar to [2,3] to predict and understand the spread of disease considering the effect of intra-host quiescence. Analytical results are obtained for the stability of the system. We especially derived a stability conditions for a five by five system with quiescent stage. Numerical simulations were also performed and we show that the period of oscillations and the time to damping off is almost double under the quiescence compared to the classic epidemiological model. We finally extended the model to include the effect of stochasticity on disease transmission and study analytically the outcome using a Markov-Chain model. The model dynamics with stochasticity follow the deterministic one.

These models generally include rules that each cell follows independently of other cells in the population. Various mechanisms and biological phenomena can be described using these simplistic mathematical models. However, these models cannot be analysed mathematically. Therefore, it can be beneficial to derive the corresponding deterministic model from the underlying random walk of the stochastic model. The resulting deterministic models, usually partial differential equations (PDEs), can then be analysed to provide further information about the biological systems studied. We have developed a range of simple IB models that describe biological systems with various properties of interest, such as, volume-filling and chemotaxis and pressure-dependent growth and proliferation. For each model, we were able to derive PDEs from the underlying random walk. We carried out comparisons between the stochastic and deterministic model highlighting situations where there is agreement in the models, and situations where they do not agree. Ultimately, the results illustrate how the simple rules governing the dynamics of single cells in our individual-based model can lead to the emergence of complex spatial patterns of population growth observed in continuum models. These models can be applied to a variety of biological situations such as tumour growth, tumour invasion and wound healing.

In biological studies, the models can change very rapidly, so the unified algorithms that do not take much effort to apply them to different models are preferable. The general inverse modeling framework based on the ensembles of the adjoint equation solutions is considered in the context of biomedical applications with the advection-diffusion-reaction models. The sensitivity relations and adjoin equations allow constructing the approximation of the inverse modeling problem stated a system of ordinary or partial differential equations in the form of a parametric family of quasi-linear operator equations with the sensitivity operators. This approximation allows both solving, analyzing, and comparing a wide range of biomedical inverse problems in a unified fashion.

Our quantitative understanding of biochemical networks empowered by computational modelling have shown that the topology (or structure) of a network often have determining roles in shaping the network’s dynamic and steady state behaviours. For examples, negative feedback can give rise to oscillation while positive feedback can bring about bistability to the host network. Thus, being able to systematically identify sub-networks with defined topological structures within the human protein interactome is critical for the discovery of biochemical networks with desired behavioural properties. However, this is a non-trivial task given the enormous complexity of the human protein-protein interaction network. Structural principles of biochemical networks can be discovered by focusing on small sub-networks. Finding those sub-networks in the assembly of complex biochemical networks can be achieved by implementing graph theory-based algorithms. Here, we develop NetScan, an open source web-based application capable of ‘scanning’ the large and complex human signalling interactome within the Signor 2. 0 and STRING databases to identify all sub-networks with given structural topologies, e. g. those with a specific negative feedback, positive feedback or feed-forward loop wiring. NetScan allows users to specify the specific input topologies and the interactome network within which it will explore, and return all the smallest sub-networks with the desired topologies. The resulting sub-networks are displayed in two forms: a detailed version which includes all interaction links, and a simplified version presenting the net effects between the nodes. In summary, NetScan is a web application that provides unprecedented ability to systematically identify and visualise sub-networks within the human protein-protein interaction network with specific topological wiring.

Unlike deterministic steady states, stationary distributions capturing inherent fluctuations of reactions are extremely difficult to derive analytically due to the curse of dimensionality. Here, we develop a method for deriving stationary distributions from deterministic steady states by transforming a network to have a special dynamic property. Specifically, we merge nodes and edges of a network to make the steady states complex balanced, i. e. , the in- and out- flows of each node are equal. By applying our approach to networks that model autophosphorylation of EGFR, PAK1, and Aurora B kinase and a multi-timescale toggle switch, we identify robustness, sensitivity, and multi-modality of their stationary distributions.

Then, I am going to analyse CRNs under the operation of join and examine conditions such that the form of the stationary distributions of a CRN is derived from the parts of the decomposed CRNs, which allows recursive application.

In previous work we have derived and fit a low dimensional dynamical model for human circadian rhythms. However, the heterogeneity of circadian behaviors (early birds/night owls) in the human population must be accounted for in the model. In this work we investigate how data collected by wearable devices (apple watch, fitbit, etc) can be used to personalize the circadian parameters and improve forecasting accuracy.

It is a complex multi-dimensional cycle that reflects developmental changes in mental and physical health, along with the day-to-day state fluctuations. Insomnia is characterised by the inability to fall asleep or stay asleep and/or waking too early and being unable to fall back asleep.  Insomnia is a sleep disorder that remains under-diagnosed.  We propose a new data driven model for classification of nocturnal awakenings in acute and chronic insomnia and normal sleep from nocturnal actigraphy collected from pre-medicated individuals with insomnia and normal sleep controls. Our model does not require sleep diaries or any other subjective information from the individuals. We derive dynamical and statistical features from the actigraphy time series data. These features are then combined in machine learning model to classify individuals with insomnia from healthy sleepers. The model includes a classifier followed by optimization algorithm that incorporates the predicted quality of each night of sleep for an individual to classify into acute/chronic insomnia or healthy group. The developed model provides a signature of acute/chronic insomnia obtained from actigraphy only and is very promising as a pre-screening tool to detect the condition in home environment.

Using this model, we investigate the different dynamics towards addiction and provide a possible description of the process of detoxification. The opponent processes are modeled by introducing a response kernel that integrates dopamine-induced neuronal activity to form a sense of reward. The shape of the kernel, which might be associated with physical and biological characteristics of neurocircuits of the brain reward system, plays a key role in determining the overall experience of consumption of addictive substances and the mismatch between the expected reward and the actual eward, the reward prediction error (RPE). With time and repeated exposures to drugs of abuse, the response kernel will change based on the value of the RPE and on the process of neuroadaptation. The dynamics of this change represents the evolution towards addiction and is mathematically described as a trajectory in a three-dimensional parameter space representing the RPE. In our framework, the surface representing the RPE is divided in two regions representing positive and negative values of value of the RPE, respectively.  We show that the dynamics associated with naïve drug users is represented by a trajectory lying in the first, positive-RPE region but, with time and repeated exposure to drugs of abuse, the trajectory will enter into the second, negative-RPE region. After transition to addiction, the subsequent dynamics is largely confined within the negative-RPE region. We finally propose models for exiting the negative-RPE parameter regions and connect it to a description of a detoxification protocols, such as the use of methadone to address heroin addiction.

Photoreceptors can be characterised as either rods or cones. Rods provide achromatic vision under low light conditions, while cones provide high-acuity colour vision under well-lit conditions. The term Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) refers to a range of genetically mediated retinal diseases that cause the loss of photoreceptors and hence visual function. RP leads to a patchy degeneration of photoreceptors and typically directly affects either rods or cones, but not both. During the course of the disease, degenerate patches spread and the photoreceptor type unaffected by the mutation also begins to degenerate. The cause underlying these phenomena is currently unknown; however, several key mechanisms have been hypothesised: oxygen toxicity, trophic factor depletion and the release of toxic substances by dying cells. Here we present mathematical models, formulated as systems of PDEs, to investigate the trophic factor hypothesis. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mathematical analysis, we determine the geographic variation in retinal susceptibility to degeneration, evaluate the degree to which in vivo spatio-temporal patterns of degeneration can be replicated by our models and predict the effects of various clinically-relevant treatment strategies.

Applications we discuss include the evolution of homogeneous tissues experiencing proliferation and death, and cancer invasion with a cancerous tissue competing for space with an adjacent normal tissue. This framework allows us to postulate new mecha- nisms that explain the ability of cancer cells to outcompete healthy cells through mechanical differences rather than by having some intrinsic proliferative advantage.

Risk spreading (“bet-hedging”) through spontaneous phenotypic variations is an evolutionary strategy that allows species to survive in temporally varying environments. Individuals within a species diversify their phenotypes ensuring that at least some of them can survive in the face of sudden environmental change. We aim to investigate whether cancer cells may adopt this strategy when dealing with rapidly changing levels of nutrient due to temporally-varying blood flow. Here, we present a system of nonlocal partial differential equations modelling the evolutionary dynamics of phenotype-structured cancer cell populations exposed to fluctuating oxygen levels. In this model, the phenotypic state of every cell is described by a continuous variable that provides a simple representation of its metabolic phenotype, ranging from fully oxidative to fully glycolytic. The cells are grouped into two competing populations that undergo heritable, spontaneous, phenotypic variations at different rates. A combination of analysis and numerical simulations indicates that under certain conditions the cell-oxygen dynamics can lead to regions of chronic hypoxia (low oxygen level) and cycling hypoxia. Moreover, the model shows that under chronic-hypoxic conditions lower rates of phenotypic variation lead to a competitive advantage, whereas higher rates of phenotypic variation can confer a competitive advantage under cycling-hypoxic conditions. In the latter case, bet-hedging evolutionary strategies, whereby cells switch between oxidative and glycolytic phenotypes, can spontaneously emerge. These results shed light on the evolutionary processes that may underpin the emergence of phenotypic heterogeneity in vascularised tumours, and suggest potential therapeutic strategies.

They develop when there are disruptions in the processes controlling the function of colonic crypts - the test-tube shaped structures that make up the lining of colon. It is currently not clear what will cause a healthy crypt to become serrated. The crypt has been extensively modelled, owing to its relatively simple composition. However, little modelling work has focused on the formation of serrated crypts, perhaps because of the relatively difficult task of modelling the epithelial monolayer on a deformable supporting structure. In this talk, we will introduce new a modelling approach that allows us to build a deformable membrane, sidestepping the issues that made the predominant off lattice models less suitable. We will then present some preliminary findings on the potential causes behind the characteristic appearance of serrated crypts elucidated by this model.

Although synergistic combinations are intuitively attractive, therapeutic success often depends on whether drug resistance develops.  In computational modeling of drug-resistance evolution, our recent work (Saputra et. al, Cancer Res, 2018) delineated conditions under which synergistic pairs of drugs would have worse long-term performance than non-synergistic pairs of drugs, due to faster evolution of drug-resistance. In this work, we extend our modeling to three-drug combinations. In a multi-drug cocktail, some pairs of drugs may be synergistic while other pairs of drugs in the same cocktail may be additive or antagonistic (quantified using the combination index). Does this matter for evolution of drug-resistance? We develop theoretical generalizations about relative performance, for winning the race between cancer-killing efficacy versus drug-resistance evolution, using multi-drug cocktails with equal efficacy but different distributions of combination index (CI). Methods: We performed mathematical modeling of tumor cells evolving under selective pressure from synergistic, additive, and antagonistic three-drug combinations. Starting with small populations of drug-sensitive cells, we allowed rare mutational events to change a cell’s phenotype toward any single drug, which over time created potential for the presence or absence of drug-resistance against any or all drugs in the multi-drug therapy. Meanwhile, proliferation and death were simulated according to the combined cocktail efficacy toward each phenotype of cell. Results and Discussion: Longer duration of cancer control was achieved by multi-drug combinations having higher uniformity of pairwise CI (i. e. , all pairs of drugs within the cocktail having similar levels of synergism, or all pairs having similar levels of antagonism), compared with multi-drug cocktails having equal initial efficacy and equal overall CI, but greater differences in the pairwise CI’s. In other words, treatment was more likely to fail sooner if the three drugs had non-uniform amounts of pairwise synergism, compared with cocktails that had more uniform CI between the drug-pairs within the cocktail. The difference in outcomes was due to partially resistant phenotypes that achieved greater competitive advantage (meaning greater clonal expansion and greater sabotage of therapy) by resisting the most synergistic aspects of the cocktail.  This is because resisting one part of a synergistic group destroys not on									  											  									  									  								  								  								  									  	Yangjin Kim								  	 								  		Konkuk University, Republic of Korea								  									  									  										  			&lt;/br&gt; How the surgery-induced transition of reactive astrocytes to stem cell-like phenotypes leads to recurrence of GBM by Cxcl5: hybrid multi-scale approaches 								  										  									  									  										  										  											  			Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain cancer with a short median survival time. GBM is characterized by the hallmarks of aggressive proliferation and cellular infiltration of normal brain tissue. Tumor cells also interact with many cells including astrocytes and immune cells, and extracellular matrix (ECM) in a tumor microenvironment (TME) via exchanging molecular signals in order to increase survival rates in response to biochemical and biomechanical challenges. miRNAs and their downstream molecules are known to play a pivotal role in regulation of the balance of proliferation and aggressive invasion in response to metabolic stress in the tumour microenvironment (TME). Surgery-induced transition in reactive astrocyte populations can dramatically change the growth and invasion dynamics of GBM cells. In this work, we develop a multi-scale mathematical model of the tumor astrocytes dynamics in response to surgical resection of the primary tumor in TME. The hybrid model takes into account miR-451-LKB1-AMPK-OCT1-mTOR pathway signalling (ODEs), individual cell dynamics of the tumour, reactive astrocytes, stem cell-like astrocytes (lattice-free individual model), and signal transport by diffusible molecules (PDEs). We show how the effects of fluctuating glucose on tumour cell dynamics need to be reprogrammed by taking into account the recent history of glucose variations and an LKB1/OCT1 reciprocal feedback loop, which then determines tumor cell proliferation and migration. The model shows that surgery-induced changes in TME are the important factors for inducing the critical transition from reactive astrocytes to stem cell-like phenotypes. The model illustrates how variations in glucose availability significantly affect the activity of signalling molecules and, in turn, lead to critical cell migration. The model also predicts that (i) microsurgery of a primary tumour induces phenotypical changes in reactive astrocytes and stem cell-like astrocytes promoting tumour cell proliferation and migration by Cxcl5, (ii) this critical transition essentially increases the recurrence potential of GBM and leads to the low survival rate of patients. Finally, we investigated a new anti-tumour strategy by Cxcl5-targeting drugs in order to prevent this critical recurrence of the tumor.

Un- derstanding these differences has significant implications for tissue engineering applications and to determine how the mechanical microenvironment may affect, for example, cancer growth and invasion. We use a continuum elasticity-based model with an active contractile component to describe the mechanosensory mechanism of a cell or cell layer adhered to a substrate. The model context focuses on the most common biophysical experimental set-ups investigating cel- lular contractility, which infer the cell-generated force from observed deformations of substrates with experimentally known mechanical properties. The mathematical model is analysed and solved using both analytical approaches (exploiting approximations and symmetry arguments) and Finite Element Methods. We use the model to explain observed cellular adaptations to changes in the mechanical properties of the underlying gel. In particular, we consider the dis- tribution of adhesion throughout a cell. For experimentally realistic distributions of adhesion points, the model is capable of recreating cell shapes and deformations that are consistent with those experimentally observed. Furthermore, energy considerations are shown to have significant implications for the optimisation of cell adhesion. Thus, we demonstrate the neces- sity of considering the whole cell-substrate system, including the patterning of adhesion, when investigating cell stiffness sensing.

Butyrate is a specific short chain fatty acid that can be modulated through diet. In this collaborative project, we seek to formulate a series of ordinary differential equations to provide a mechanistic description of the dynamic effects of butyrate on cells of the immune system locally in the intestine and on bone health through systemic consequences. The team involves three mathematical biologists with chemical engineering backgrounds and an experimental collaborator with expertise in the physiological interactions between the digestive, immune, and musculoskeletal systems.

The hormone erythropoietin (Epo) is the main factor regulating erythropoiesis, the process by which erythrocytes are produced. In adult humans, Epo is produced principally in the kidney and released in response to hypoxia in order to stimulate the production of more erythrocytes. Patients suffering from severe kidney impairment therefore under-produce RBCs and subsequently suffer from severe anemia. Exogenous administration of synthetic Epo is required, but what is the optimal dose, and how frequently should it be given? To even begin to address such questions, and to understand the underlying process requires a mathematical model. We develop a model consisting of two delay differential equations that reflects the effect of Epo on increasing the production rate of erythrocytes by preventing the apoptosis of its precursor cells. The explicit modelling of the Epo concentration will allow for later use of the model in the case of exogenous dosing of Epo. We analyse our proposed model, and as expected, are able to prove the non-negativity of solutions and the existence of a unique steady-state solution for the system which represents the normal number of mature erythrocytes and the concentration of Epo for a healthy human. We find a simple condition on the other parameters under which the steady state is locally asymptotically stable for arbitrary large delays. When this parameter condition is violated we show that the steady state is stable for small delays and loses its stability through a Hopf bifurcation.

Recent research suggests that forces from the local blood flow (haemodynamic forces) trigger polarized endothelial cell migration against the flow, resulting in capillary collapse and regression. However, vascular regression is also driven by several additional pathways including local adhesion forces and cellular signalling factors. Due to the delicate nature of these microvessels, it is difficult to experimentally untangle the roles of each pathway during vascular development. As such, the development of computational models to analyse the relationship between the local haemodynamic forces and the surrounding vasculature during regression are invaluable. In this talk, we will present a novel computational framework to mathematically study and isolate the role of haemodynamic and adhesive forces in vessel deformation and endothelial cell migration during vascular regression. To model regression, we describe the capillary wall as a discretised hyperelastic membrane, hosting a multicellular model of endothelial cells. The capillary wall and the endothelial cells interact with and respond to the local blood flow in an iterative manner, creating a coupled fluid-structure growth simulation. This discrete approach provides a natural framework to consider the relationship between the capillary wall and the local blood flow, and allows for the easy inclusion of structural heterogeneities across the capillary wall. Using this model we are able to examine the relative roles of the haemodynamic forces and the local adhesion forces in vascular regression, and the network level ramifications of local regression.

Recently, metapopulation theory has been used to model host-associated microbiomes, with hosts acting as patches, and microbes as dispersing organisms. Extending this framework to scenarios where the hosts themselves exist as metapopulations gives what we term 'nested metapopulations'. Although similar models have been studied in epidemiology, the focus is typically the effect of limited dispersal among patches on disease spread.  What is not considered, however, is the other key premise of ecological metapopulations - frequent extinction events at the patch scale. We explore models of nested metapopulations, focusing on how host-scale metapopulation structure and microbe-scale metapopulation structure interact to govern the distribution of microbes across both hosts and the habitat patches in which they live.

Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of microbial communities is a key step towards the goal of manipulating microbiomes to promote beneficial states. While interactions within a microbial community and between microbes and their environment collectively determine the community composition and population dynamics, we are often concerned with traits or functions of a microbiome that link more directly to host health. To study how traits of a microbiome are impacted by eco-evolutionary dynamics, we recast a classic resource-mediated population dynamic model into a population genetic framework which incorporates traits. Using simple communities as example, we illustrate how natural selection, mutation, and shifts in the environment work together to produce changes in trait values over time.

These dynamics are typically hard to analyze, especially for high number of strains and population structure. Diversity in interaction traits enables the strains to create dynamically their niches for growth and persistence, ‘engineer’ and respond to their common environment. How such a network of interactions with others mediates collective coexistence remains hard to understand, and integrate with intervention effects such as drugs and vaccines. Furthermore, the gradients shaping stability and complexity in such systems remain poorly understood. In a mathematical study, we present a new analytic framework for an N-strain SIS epidemiological system with altered susceptibilities to co-colonization/co-infection between strains. We map the multi- strain SIS dynamics to a replicator equation for N frequencies using separation of timescales. This framework enables explicit examination of the key drivers of competition and coexistence regimes in such a system. We find the ratio of single to co-colonization μ critically determines the type of equilibrium and number of coexisting strains. This key quantity in the model encodes a trade-off between overall transmission intensity R0 and mean interaction coefficient in strain space k, and links our model with the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) in ecology. I will show how this co-colonization model provides fresh insights for understanding critical transitions in community dynamics potentiated by mean-field and environmental gradients.

Lytic phages replicate within their host cells and destroy them during phage release making them highly specific anti-microbial agents. Bacterial and phage population dynamics do not only depend on life styles but also on the details of the infection process of a specific bacterium and corresponding phage: Some phages can enter a bacterium at multiple sites whereas others are restricted to a single or few entry points. Bacteria further defend against phage induced lysis by various mechanisms including adaptive CRISPR-Cas immunity. Generally, the interaction between lytic phages with their corresponding susceptible bacteria is followed by rapid emergence of bacterial resistance against these phages. The time scales for the emergence (and sustainment) of resistance as well as the specific temporal evolution of bacterial and phage population sizes depend on the characteristics both of the specific phage and corresponding bacterial strain. This pattern can be seen as a kinetic fingerprint which gives insights into the underlying dynamics including binding kinetics and mechanisms of bacterial resistance and phage evasion. In studying the interaction between Klebsiella pneumoniae and its corresponding phage we see enhanced inter-phage synergy leading to faster depletion of bacterial populations than expected from simple mass action kinetics. Within our modelling framework we discuss potential underlying mechanisms of phage binding and synergy as well as the relevance of the kinetic fingerprint in characterizing the interaction between bacteria and phages.

The characteristics of this system influence the infants health in both the short- and long-term. It differs in striking ways from that found in adults,both in composition and in dynamics. The first few days generally feature an initial dominance of facultative anaerobic species such as Enterobacteriaceae, most often followed by a dominance of anaerobic species, particularly Bifidobacteriaceae. While the influence of oxygen in this succession is often hypothesised, there is no clear view of the impact or mechanism of this influence. We use a multi-scale spatiotemporal model of the infant colon to simulate the effects of variations in initial oxygen concentration on the composition and metabolic activity of the microbiota from birth to three weeks of age. Using flux balance analysis with molecular crowding on a consortium of genome-scale metabolic models from the AGORA project, we calculate species-specific bacterial fluxes for different locations and time points at a high resolution. The resulting fluxes are integrated together into a model of the ecosystem that feeds back into the flux calculations [3]. The model takes into account the nutrition and development of the infant, and can so give insight and produce predictions for the composition and metabolite formation of the infant microbiota over time and under different conditions. We find that the initial presence of oxygen can explain the specific early dominance of Enterobacteriaceae and the succession by Bifidobacteriaceae out of a broad consortium of infant microbiota species. This is derived solely from the genome-derived differences in oxygen metabolism between species, without having to take into account oxygen toxicity. We also show a complex network of spatial separation and metabolic interactions emerging within the infant gut. Our general aim is to reach a deeper understanding of the major metabolic influences, such as prebiotics and nutrition as a whole, on the development of the infant microbiota. This in turn is the first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of the formation of a steady state adult GI-tract microbiota.

The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this novel coronavirus.  Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5 infected patients hospitalized with severe disease.  Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0. 7 to 9 ng/mL.  Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are quite immunogenic.  In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike.  Cyro-electron microscopy structures of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two RBDs revealed recognition of the closed, “all RBD-down” conformation of the spike.  Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.

Apical constriction is a ubiquitous cell shape change of epithelial tissues that promotes epithelia folding and cell/tissue invagination in a variety of contexts.  Apical constriction promotes tissue bending by changing the shape of constituent cells from a columnar-shape to a wedge-shape.  Drosophila gastrulation is one of the classic examples of apical constriction, where cells constrict to fold the primitive epithelial sheet and internalize cells that will give rise to internal organs. We have used a combination of imaging, experimental perturbation, and modeling, to determine how actomyosin organization promotes tissue folding.  The actin cytoskeleton is organized in both time and space to facilitate apical constriction.  We found that actomyosin contraction is pulsatile and requires dynamic regulation of upstream signaling processes. In addition, we found that actomyosin becomes organized into oriented fibers, which generates anisotropic tension that is critical for tissue shape.  Furthermore, connectivity within the network of actomyosin fibers is highly redundant, promoting the robustness of folding.

While in highly dynamic situations like development, cell migration or wound healing, cells need to be soft and viscous, in homeostatic situations like maintenance of connective or epithelial tissues, they have to keep stresses and strains for long times, like an elastic material. Because the actomyosin cytoskeleton determining cell mechanics is in a state of constant turnover, achieving effectively elastic behavior is a real challenge for cells. In this talk, I will first discuss the experimental evidence for the elastic behavior of cells, including the invaginated shapes of single cells in connective tissue and the elastic nature of epithelial monolayers as revealed by traction force and monolayer stress microscopy. I then will discuss different mechanisms which allow this elastic behavior to emerge on cellular scales, including the generation of stress fibers, the exchange dynamics of fast and slow myosin motors in myosin minifilaments and their regulation through the Rho-pathway, which can be controlled e. g. by optogenetics. In each case, I will address the fundamental question how multi-scale modeling and homogenization techniques can be used to mathematically connect the microscopic and macroscopic scales.

Such movement of cells naturally requires forces. How cells generate forces through molecular pathways is thus an intense field of study. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly appreciated that forces, and other physical properties, not only arise from intracellular pathways, but can also reprogram pathways, for instance, through molecular mechanosensors. I will present recent results obtained from mathematical modelling and experimental work aimed at investigating the interplay of physical, geometrical and molecular drivers of tumour progression. At the example of an endothelial cell monolayer, I will show how forces alter the chemical binding rates of cell-cell adhesions, which consequently can lead to gaps in the monolayer. Experiments show that these gaps can be exploited by cancer cells when transmigrating through the endothelial monolayer - a crucial process during metastasis. I will then present some work on modelling mechano-chemical pathways in cells. Pathways including the YAP/TAZ and Rho signalling pathways are sensitive e. g. to extrinsic factors such as extracellular stiffness, or intrinsic factors such as cellular geometry. The complex interplay of such factors can lead to reprogramming of cells. Consequently, a physically altered tumour microenvironment can activate intracellular pathways and, independent or complementary to genetic changes, alter tumour cells towards more aggressive behaviour.

The mechanism by which this mechanosensing is achieved is broadly understood. Molecular motors em- bedded within the cellular cytoskeletal network bring the network into tension - this contraction is resisted by the cellular adhesion to the external environment with the degree of resistance thus broadly signalling information about the local external stiffness. Great strides have been made in understanding the molec- ular signalling mechanisms mechanisms with research focusing on the focal adhesions, supramolecular adhesive patches, and on pathways such as YAP/TAZ. However, there is emerging evidence of signalling away from focal adhesions including at the nuclear envelope (nuclear mechanotransduction). This necessitates a spatially resolved model of cell stiffness sensing that incorporates intracellular mechani- cal interactions. Here I will present a continuum elasticity model of cellular contractility and stiffness sensing that accounts for the experimentally observed variations in contractile activity within cells. This model demonstrates how on stiff substrates non-uniform contraction will lead to localised regions of internal cell stretch well away from focal adhesions. Additionally where the cell shape is elongated (as is often observed on stiff substrates) this effect is enhanced with increased internal stretch as compared with isotropic cells. These internal strains offer a potential physical mechanism linking physical exter- nal substrate stiffness to stretch activated molecular signalling within the cell and at the nuclear envelope.

In Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, forces result from ATP-hydrolysis-driven extension-retraction cycles of extracellular filaments called type-IV pili. How bacteria adapt their pilus-based behavior to the mechanical environment is not known. Here, we show that the early stage of surface colonization by P. aeruginosa is modulated by substrate-dependent pilus activity. Our experimental data reveals a complex response of the bacterial migration machinery to substrate properties, including adaptation of the dynamics of pili, their spatial arrangement, and their number. The combination of the experimental data with mathematical modeling allows us to construct a comprehensive picture of the stochastic dynamics of pilus-based motion of P. aeruginosa on different substrates. Overall, our findings reveal how mechanoregulation is involved in essential aspects of the migratory behavior of a paradigmatic bacterial pathogen.

NK cell exhaustion, a phenotype characterized by reduced effector functionality, can limit the NK cell’s capacity for cell lysis. The processes mediating NK cell exhaustion are many, unfortunately, rendering a single preventative approach unlikely to be optimal in all cases. In lieu of prevention, we investigated in silico whether the effects of exhaustion can be nullified by strategies that maximize the continuous secretion of effector molecules. Here, we constructed a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describes the dynamics of the cytolytic molecules granzyme B (GZMB) and perforin-1 (PRF1). The model predictions were calibrated to published, experimental data where the model parameters were estimated via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Furthermore, the model was interrogated using an information-theoretic global sensitivity analysis, to determine which model parameters (i. e. , inputs) shared a significant degree of mutual information with the secreted amount of effector molecules (i. e. , outputs). Interestingly, we found the inhibition of phosphatase activity maximizes the secretion of GZMB and PRF1. We appended the baseline model with a system of ODEs describing a synthetic Notch (synNotch) signaling circuit as a method for controlling the production and secretion of the cytolytic molecules. Briefly, the synNotch receptor is chimeric molecule consisting of a target-ligand specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv) in its extracellular domain, a string of cleavable amino acid sequences in its transmembrane domain and a transcription factor in its intracellular domain. Once bound to a target ligand, the synNotch receptor is cleaved by membrane proteases. This unchains the transcription factor from the cell membrane, and thereby freeing the molecule to initiate gene expression by binding to a plasmid. We included two separate plasmids in the model: (1) a multi-cistronic plasmid coding for the effector molecules and (2) a plasmid coding for a long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA) molecule that binds and sequesters the phosphatase from inhibiting signal transduction. The synNotch model was optimized by determining the optimal quantity of plasmids and synNotch receptor to maximize the secretion of the effector molecules while using the minimum amount of material. We found the optimal synNotch system depends on the frequency of NK cell stimulation: for fewer rounds of stimulation, both plasmids should be given at maximal dose; for many rounds of stimulation, the model predicts only the cytolytic molecule-coding plasmid should be given and at maximal value. This suggests that inhibition of phosphatase activity, while beneficial in the short-term, is not optimal for multiple rounds of stimulation. In total, we developed a theoretical framework that provides actionable insight into engineering robust NK cells for clinical applications.

Using experimental data from SIV infected macaques, we identify key parameters related to the brain infection, including virus-transfer across blood-brain barrier.

The analysis of the model shows the conditions of virus coexistence or elimination in the host organism.

Recently, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbiota have emerged as key regulatory participants in shaping the immune system.  Butyrate, the most versatile among SCFAs, has been observed to have local and systemic effects including inducing the differentiation of peripheral regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the intestine, blood, and bone marrow [1].  Tregs are the central actors of the negative feedback component of the immune system.  The interaction between Tregs and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells suppress the inflammatory status and promote the production of Wnt10b to increase bone anabolism [2].  Studies in the mouse models show that the ablation of butyrate in the intestine alters the bone marrow density.  However, the therapeutic benefit of butyrate in bone anabolism remains poorly understood. We developed a multi-compartment physiologically based pharmacokinetic model to track and quantify the effects of butyrate on Tregs in the gut, blood, and bone marrow.  The model consists of five species butyrate, naive CD4+ T cells, Tregs, TGF-β, and Wnt10b distributed across three compartments intestine, blood, and bone.  We consider an open system with the processes of formation, excretion, differentiation, cell death, and migration to another compartment.  The variation of butyrate concentration from homeostasis value changes the percentage of Tregs, and the production of TGF-β, and Wnt10b.  Using the model, we analyze experimental data reported in [2] to evaluate the expansion of Tregs, TGF-β, and Wnt10b in the bone marrow.  The probiotic LGG increases butyrate concentration in the intestine and serum blood by 0. 18 μM and 0. 29 μM respectively.  Our simulation result shows 5% increase of Tregs, 3. 4-fold increase of TGF-β, and 3-fold increase of Wnt10b in the bone marrow consistent with the net change information due to stimulus of a probiotic microbiota in the gut.  The computational approach described here gives insight into the pharmacokinetics of butyrate, biodistribution of Tregs in the gut-bone axis, fold changes of Wnt10b in bone marrow, and their contributions to modulating bone formation.

The rise of artemisinin resistance, which is the main component of most recommended anti-malarial regimens, has prompted the need to develop better alternative antimalarial treatments. Modelling plays an important role in the development of these new antimalarial drugs. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models of antimalarial treatment, which relate drug concentration to parasite killing, are central in assessing and optimizing drug therapy effectiveness. A common assumption in these models is that the parasites that remain in circulation after treatment are all viable. Recently a method was developed to estimate the concentration of viable parasites after artesunate treatment, rather than simply total parasite numbers. Here, we aimed to include this additional parasite viability information into an adapted PK/PD model to more accurately estimate the drug killing rate in sensitive and resistant infections. We use data from volunteers infected with artemisinin-sensitive or resistant P. falciparum blood-stage parasites and treated with a single dose of oral artesunate monotherapy during a volunteer infection study. Parasite qPCR counts before and after treatment, the proportion of viable parasites after treatment and dihydroartemisinin plasma concentration were obtained and modelled using age-structured P. falciparum parasite population growth and a PK/PD model. We use these models for separately measuring parasite killing rate and parasite clearance rate. The addition of viability data into PK/PD model of artesunate monotherapy provided a good fit of the data. The model estimated an in vivo DHA’s EC50 of 1. 42 μg/L (95% CI: 0. 07, 2. 78). In artemisinin-sensitive infections, the parasites mean killing half-life is 0. 20 h (95% CI: 0. 16 h,0. 26 h) and the mean removal half-life of dead parasites was 2. 77 h (95% CI: 2. 4 h, 3. 4 h). Further, we showed that the reduced killing observed in resistant infections were consistent with a 9-fold reduction in the sensitivity of parasites in the first 12 h of the lifecycle, and drug-killed resistant parasites were estimated to be removed slower than drug-killed sensitive parasites. Incorporating parasite viability data into PK/PD models allows refining the estimation of parasite killing rates and provides information on the stage-specific activity of antimalarial drugs in vivo. Killing half-life is faster than previously thought. These differences are likely to have important implications for optimal dosing strategies and predicting overall drug efficacy.

Using appropriate payoff functions relating to the perception of risk measured using disease incidence and severity of infection the model is coupled to a series of human behaviors including ignoring social distancing, and breaking out of isolation and quarantine. Analysis and simulations of the model show the possibility of multiple waves of infection. Discouraging the population from disease magnifying behavior such as escaping from isolation and quarantine eliminates the multiple waves of infection and greatly flattens the curves.

What are the conditions under which SARS-CoV-2 becomes Just Another Seasonal Coronavirus? 								  										  									  									  										  										  											  			Background: Will SARS-CoV-2 become Just Another Seasonal Coronavirus? It bears some important resemblances with its more benign cold-causing relatives, after all. For example, Coronavirus NL63 uses the same ACE2 receptor to gain entry into cells, and circumstantial evidence suggests Coronavirus OC43 may have caused a pandemic in the late 1800's. Both are now just 'common colds'. Is it possible that SARS-CoV-2 will take the same path? Hypotheses: We are writing models to address how three factors might push SARS-CoV-2 towards JASC. First, evidence suggests asymptomatic cases tend to shed less virus. If viral dose affects disease severity, and vice versa, selection might act to alleviate virulence. Second, we know that kids are far less likely to experience more severe forms of COVID-19, and different disease outcomes in kids vs adults will influence the epidemiology in important ways. Third, the JASC hypothesis might be sensitive to the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Eventually we hope to consider cross-immunity or interaction with other viruses, including seasonal coronaviruses, with a view to understand the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of the pre-existing respiratory virome. Results: Our models show that JASC is possible if viral dose correlates with disease severity and if immunity is sufficiently strong and long-lasting. We will present analyses of how our three factors influence the long-term outcomes of the pandemic. Conclusions: Although it is too early to say for certain, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 could persist in humans as another cold-causing virus.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild symptoms, are major contributors in the propagation of COVID-19, a first for a respiratory virus. In another first, COVID-19 caused generalized restrictions to human movement and interactions. In this talk, we will discuss a traditional compartmentalized mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers and lock-down conditions. The theoretical model is used to calibrate a model for the City of San Antonio, Texas.

We assume uncertain scenarios with limited testing capacity, lack of reliable data, under-reporting of cases, and restricted testing policy. To deal with data and model uncertainties, we developed a Bayesian framework for the identification of model parameters. A global sensitivity analysis is performed beforehand to identify the most significant parameters on either the cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases, or the effective reproduction number. Less important parameter values are set according to the current knowledge on the disease in order to overcome the bottleneck of parameter identifiability. We show that the model parameter related to social distancing measures is one of the most influential along all stages of the disease spread and the most influential after the infection peak. Different relaxation strategies of social distancing measures are then investigated in order to determine which strategies are viable and less hazardous to the population. The results highlight the need of keeping social distancing policies to control the disease spread. Specifically, the considered scenario of abrupt social distancing relaxation implemented after the occurrence of the peak of positively diagnosed cases can prolong the epidemic, with a significant increase of the projected numbers of confirmed and death cases. An even worse scenario could occur if the quarantine relaxation policy is implemented before evidence of the epidemiological control, indicating the importance of the proper choice of when to start relaxing social distancing measures. The employed approach and subsequent analysis applied over the Brazilian scenarios may be used to other locations.

New Mexico ranks as the third highest state in the United States for per capita testing, and the time from identification of a traced contact to quarantine is two days; however, during the past seven days, cases have been increasing by 1. 8% per day, leaving open the question of how best to intervene in the epidemic, given limited resources. Recent modeling studies have addressed mitigation strategies for COVID-19; however, there is a need for an age-structured mitigation model that provides pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, symptomatic, testing, and quarantine compartments. We developed a deterministic, Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model to assess the merits of a range of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures. We simulated all combinations of three social distancing levels, six testing levels, three testing turnaround speeds, and four testing accuracy levels, in order to evaluate 216 mitigation scenarios. We found that social distancing and testing are both necessary for decreasing total infections and for delaying the peak of the epidemic. We additionally found that increasing the turnaround speed of test results and decreasing the proportion of false negative tests has the potential to result in 27% fewer infections and 33% fewer deaths over the course of a two-year simulated epidemic. The epidemic outcomes are mitigated more effectively when school-aged individuals have less contact, as when schools are closed or operating virtually, than when working-aged individuals have less contact, as when businesses are closed or operating virtually. These are difficult but important prioritizations.

Cell culturing involves a wide range of variables and optimal protocols are currently undefined when co-culturing different cell types in vitro. A ‘trial and error’ based experimental approach to optimisation is inefficient and costly and relies on animal-derived in vitro models.  We propose a combined and iterative in silico} / in vitro approach to optimising experimental cell culturing protocols using a small number of experiments to validate parametric mathematical models which can in turn be used to predict optimum conditions. Here, we focus on the trade-off between the cell differentiation media required to allow co-culturing of muscle fibres with neurons and optimal muscle cell growth. During myogenesis, myoblast cells fuse together to create multinucleated myotubes which elongate and mature into muscle fibres.  Fixed and time-lapse images of muscle cells were acquired throughout the differentiation and early myotube formation phases for cells cultured in muscle differentiation medium, neuron differentiation medium and a 1:1 mixture of both media. Metrics of myoblast migration speed, migration direction and rate of fusion were quantified from time-lapse imaging and used to inform a mathematical agent-based model (ABM) of myoblast motion and fusion. Metrics of myotube growth and alignment over time were quantified and used to validate the ABM output. The validated ABM can then be used to conduct virtual trials in different media conditions in order to ascertain the optimum balance between muscle growth and specialisation of differentiation medium.

In addition to uncertainty from modelling, experimental set-up and measurement, there is another source of error that needs to be factored in: Crosstalk denotes the interaction of neighboured samples during measurement and cannot be ignored in fluorescence intensity measurement scenarios. In order to quantify the indispensability of crosstalk, we formulate two models for the measurement process: one without crosstalk and one with crosstalk. These models contain a high number of unknowns due to properties of the measurement instrument and of the experimental set-up. Our goal is to identify the most plausible model from given data and assumed measurement uncertainties and use it for parameter estimation afterwards. For this we employ a Bayesian model selection approach where we compute the evidence for either model with the nested sampling algorithm, which is suited for high-dimensional problems. This allows us to simultaneously pick the most favourable model and obtain parameter samples from the posterior.

Understanding biological responses to cell-membrane / virus-like-particles is a key to developing potential therapeutics and vaccines to viruses. Endocytosis is a cellular mechanism where a cell internalizes substances from the external environment. In endocytosis, external objects such as nanoparticles, virus-like particles (VLP), or chemicals adhere to the cell surface. The cell then envelopes these adsorbed particles typically by wrapping a portion of its own cell membrane around these particles. The adsorbed material then becomes trapped inside the vesicle, effectively becoming a ‘cargo’ or ‘payload’, and the cell transports this vesicle into the cell. In endocytosis, external objects can either adhere directly to the cell membrane with a certain affinity, or they can bind to explicit membrane receptors. There are many unanswered scientific questions when we are trying to better understand the endocytosis process.  The realism, the amount of physical detail required in a ‘useful’ model, can differ widely and very much depends on what kinds of questions we ask. For example, do we need to include individual lipids?, explicit individual atoms? Or is it sufficient to have a more coarse-grained model that treats individual VLPs as discrete particles? We are developing tools that will give users the flexibility they need to create multi-scale biophysics models that include different (and therefore more appropriate) levels of physical detail and realism.  We present a new particle-based simulation environment, Mechanica, that enables users to interactively create, manipulate and simulate models of biological cells and tissues using physics-motivated python API. Using Mechanica, researchers can explore the kinds of information and ask the questions required to model accurately, say, at a level that sits between coarse-grained molecular dynamics and cell-center models. We present a composite particle based simulation approach where we augment the traditional cell-center-model type cells with explicit surface receptor binding sites, and model explicit external VLP particles, where we have explicit surface receptors that can diffuse about the cell surface, and explicitly bind to external VLPs. We allow VLPs to explicitly bind to surface receptors, and we demonstrate our event model, where users can bind cellular responses such as particle adsorption to events.  Our user model description API is based on physical and chemical abstractions which enables a great deal of freedom for our users in the kinds of semantic meaning they ascribe to physical objects. For example, a user could choose to allow one of our ‘particles’ to represent a molecule, nano-particle, cellular organelle, or even a complete cell.

There exists an important class of reactions that result in a phase change from liquid to solid: precipitation reactions. Inspired by recent microfluidic experiments, this talk describes a novel mathematical framework for handling such reactions occurring within a slow-moving fluid flow. A key challenge for precipitate reactions is that, in general, the location of the developed solid is unknown a priori. To model this situation, we use a multiphase framework with fluid and solid phases; the aqueous chemicals exist as scalar fields that react within the fluid to induce phase change. To demonstrate the functionality of this framework, we conduct full-scale simulations in a realistic microfluidic geometry. The framework can be applied to precipitate reactions where the precipitate greatly affects the surrounding flow, a situation appearing in many laboratory and geophysical contexts including the hydrothermal vent theory for the origin of life. More generally, this model can be used to address low Reynolds number fluid–structure interaction problems that feature the dynamic generation of solids.

The IS is built around a TCR-peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) core, and is surrounded by an integrin ring (Monks, et al. , 1998). Small immunoglobulin superfamily (sIGSF) adhesion complexes form a corolla of microdomains outside the integrin ring, which is shown to recruit and retain the major costimulatory and checkpoint complexes that regulate the responses to TCR engagement (Demetriou, et al. , 2019). The positioning of these molecules drives T cell signaling and fate decision, making forces that govern IS formation of particular interest. To gain insights into the mechanisms underlying molecular reorganization and characteristic pattern formation during IS formation, we developed a general agent-based simulation platform able to test different hypotheses. The simulations suggest the following: 1. A radial gradient of integrin complexes (LFA-1-ICAM-1) in the peripheral supramolecular activation cluster (pSMAC) toward the central SMAC (cSMAC) emerged as a combined consequence of actin binding and diffusion and modified the positioning of other molecules (Siokis, et al. , 2018). 2. The costimulatory complexes CD28-CD80 passively follow the TCR-pMHC microcluster centripetal movement, however their characteristic localization in a ring-like pattern around the cSMAC only emerges with a particular CD28-actin coupling strength that induces a centripetal motion (Yokosuka, et al. , 2008; Siokis, et al. , 2018). 3. sIGSF complexes are passively excluded to the distal aspect of the IS provided their interactions with the ramified F-actin transport network are sufficiently weak (Siokis, et al. , 2018; Siokis, et al. , 2020). 4. Attractive forces between sIGSF adhesion (such as CD2-CD58) and costimulatory complexes (such as CD28-CD80) relocate the latter from the IS-centre to the corolla (Siokis, et al. , 2020). 5. Size-based sorting interactions with large glycocalyx components, such as CD45, explain the sIGSF adhesion corolla `petals' (Siokis, et al. , 2020). 6. A short-range self-attraction between sIGSF complexes explain the corolla `petals' (Siokis, et al. , 2020). This establishes a general simulation framework that can recapitulate complex pattern formation processes observed in cell-bilayer and cell-cell interfaces.

Breast cancer progresses in a multistep process from primary tumor growth and stroma invasion to metastasis. Progression is accompanied by a switch to an invasive cell phenotype. Nutrient-limiting environments promote chemotaxis with aggressive morphologies characteristic of invasion. It is unknown how co-existing cells differ in their response to nutrient limitations and how this impacts invasion of the metapopulation as a whole. We integrate mathematical modeling with microenvironmental perturbation-data to investigate invasion in nutrient-limiting environments inhabited by one or two cancer cell subpopulations. Hereby, subpopulations are defined by their energy efficiency and chemotactic ability. We estimate the invasion-distance traveled by a homogeneous population. For heterogeneous populations, our results suggest that an imbalance between nutrient efficacy and chemotactic superiority accelerates invasion. Such imbalance will spatially segregate the two populations and only one type will dominate at the invasion front. Only if these two phenotypes are balanced do the two subpopulations compete for the same space, which decelerates invasion. We investigate ploidy as a candidate biomarker of this phenotypic heterogeneity to discern circumstances when inhibiting chemotaxis amplifies internal competition and decelerates tumor progression, from circumstances that render clinical consequences of chemotactic inhibition unfavorable.

Local dynamics of drug-free steady states are studied and Hopf-bifurcation is observed with delay bifurcation parameter. By formulating a quadratic control based functional, an optimal control problem is constructed with treatments as control variables. The formulation of the functional is aimed at minimizing the proliferation rate of tumor cells and the detrimental effects of injected drugs. Additionally, maximizing the effector cells and maintaining an attributed level of normal cells are also a priority. By applying Pontryagin’s maximum principle, the sufficient and necessary conditions of optimality system are established. The sensitivity analysis of cost functional is performed with different combinations of control variables. The cost-effectiveness analysis is carried out to determine the most cost-effective strategy. The numerical results verify analytical findings and demonstrate that a multi-therapeutic treatment protocol can alleviate tumor burden within a few months of drug administration.

Bone pain occurs as a result of the interaction between myeloma cells and the trabecular bone microenvironment. Bone is a highly dynamic tissue that is maintained in homeostasis through a balance between bone resorption and bone formation. Multiple myeloma tips the balance in favor of bone resorption, creating a “vicious cycle” in which growth factors released by bone resorption leads to increased survival of multiple myeloma cells, which in turn results in more bone destruction. Multiple myeloma is treatable but largely incurable due to the failure of treatment to completely eradicate the disease. Because the interactions between multiple myeloma and the bone microenvironment contribute to the progression of the disease, it is essential to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of the vicious cycle to improve treatment response. To explore these dynamics, we developed a hybrid agent-based model that is integrated with published data and data generated by the Lynch lab.  We simulate the progression of myeloma growth and bone disease, starting from normal bone remodeling dynamics. To test the assumptions of the normal bone model, we perturb model parameters and show that the model is consistent with data from similar in-vivo experiments. We discuss which model assumptions and parameters are necessary to drive the vicious cycle and capture the data from an in-vivo model of multiple myeloma. This computational model provides a foundation to explore how spatiotemporal dynamics between multiple myeloma and bone microenvironment contribute to drug resistance and tumor growth which ultimately has the potential to help improve treatment strategies.

The drug is presently undergoing Phase I and II clinical trials. RG7388 was generally well tolerated, with GI toxicity being the most commonly reported adverse event. In laboratory cultures of MOLM-13 wild type cells it was observed that using increasing dosages of RG7388 led, within 3 months, to a complete replacement of wild type (drug-sensitive) cells by mutant (drug-resistant) cells. We propose a model for the growth of the two strains of cells in such cultures that is designed to elucidate whether the replacement is due to the RG7388 selecting for mutant type cells or rather generating the mutants the TP53 mutant clones.

GBM-associated death rates remain high, in part because the last few decades have produced only modest advances in treatment. Consequently, the standard therapy for GBM remains palliative, rather than curative, and patients ultimately die from this disease. Chemotherapy has proven to be effective against cancers in general; however, in the case of brain tumors, it has failed to produce sustained remission. Developed in collaboration with experimentalists we present a quantitative framework that captures the specific pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of three different chemotherapeutic agents: temozolomide, Avastin, and vincristine. The effect of these drugs is incorporated into a simple tumor growth model and parametrized using clinical data. The resulting models are used to virtually simulate novel dosage schedules for these drugs and predict their potential in improving survival times.

However, well-developed in silico tools can be used to facilitate this in vitro to in vivo translation, and we here propose using an agent-based model to bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo research. In order to capture the multi-scale nature of cancer, when simulating cancer growth and treatment re- sponses, we use a multi-scale, agent-based model that links individual cell behaviour with the macroscopic behaviour of cell organisation and the microenvironment. We highlight how agent-based models, that are currently underutilised in pharmaceutical contexts, can be used in preclinical drug development and in finding optimal treatment schedules. In pursuit of hindering the onset of drug resistance in melanoma, we investigate various targeted drug dosing regimens in silico. 									  											  									  									  								  								  						  										 						 																		 		  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  																																		 	OTHE: Other Contributed Talks (1:30-3:30pm)													 						  			  				  							  							  										  									  	Eleanor Doman								  	 								  		UCL, London								  									  									  										  			&lt;/br&gt; Investigating the mechanical properties of peripheral nerve tissue using new biomechanical models 								  										  									  									  										  										  											  			It is estimated that 2. 8% of trauma patients suffer damage to the peripheral nerve system leading to potentially permanent disability. The current gold standard treatment for peripheral nerve injury, the nerve autograph, is estimated to have a success rate of 40 to 50% depending on the scale of the injury. New nerve repair options are currently being developed including the use of tissue engineered implants to replace the injured nerve. However for this to be an effective treatment, the implant must match the mechanical properties of the native tissue to prevent additional damage due to the build-up of localised stress. Peripheral nerves are complex structures with mechanical properties that vary with nerve type and along the length of each nerve. Past experimental work has inferred a link between the mechanical properties of nerve and the nano-structural make-up of the nerve. Data on the mechanical properties of living tissue is difficult to obtain, however, the data on structure of the nerve can be obtained from cadavers. Our work therefore focuses on constructing new biomechanical models that predict the mechanical properties of a nerve given structural data. To do this we use asymptotic homogenisation - an analytical technique that exploits differences in spatial scales to solve PDE systems on spatially complex domains. We will discuss our work on constructing general biomechanical models and their specific application to peripheral nerves.

Impaired tissue perfusion has been identified as a significant contributing factor to glaucoma. Theoretical modeling provides a useful tool for predicting the effect of several hemodynamic factors on retinal oxygenation.  In this study, a heterogeneous model of the retinal arteriolar vascular network is used to show the impact of flow regulation on tissue oxygenation as oxygen demand is varied.  The metabolic signal (Si) is implemented as a wall-derived signal that reflects the oxygen deficit along the network, and three cases of conduction are considered: no conduction, a constant signal, and a flow-weighted signal.  The model shows that the increases in average tissue PO2 due to a flow-weighted signal are often more significant than if the entire level of signal is increased. This indicates that the heterogeneity of the downstream conducted responses serves to regulate flow better than a constant conducted response.  A hybrid model is also presented that combines a heterogeneous arteriolar network with a compartmental vascular network model for the capillaries and veins. This hybrid model combines a wall-derived conducted metabolic response with spatial data from the retinal arterial network to yield improved predictions of retinal tissue oxygenation.

There has been extensive work on the analysis of these cell-level models which have been upscaled to organ level. However, there is a lack of understanding of the effects of fibroblast coupling has on the spatial propagation of the action potentials. We identify two properties of the degree of fibrosis. Firstly, the number of fibroblasts in relation to the number of myocytes and secondly the geometry of the fibrotic region. Using direct numerical simulations of a monodomain model of fibrous cardiac tissue, we demonstrate that action potentials (APs) slow down as the severity of fibrosis is increased until eventually excitation is fully blocked. We also identify two cases of non-uniform fibroblast distribution. Here direct numerical simulations show that successful AP propagation is dependent on the geometry of the fibrous region and the number of fibroblasts per myocyte.

Furthermore, tumor tissue and tumor microenvironment properties can dynamically evolve not only during tumor growth but also when anticancer treatments are administered. We developed a suite of computational models to recapitulate the complexity of cancers, especially their physical and chemical microenvironments. These simulation tools were used to: derive hypotheses about the development of ductal microinvasions; formulate hypotheses on relative importance of microenvironmental factors and chemotherapeutic treatments on the growth of organoids derived from a non-tumorigenic breast cell line and its mutants; examine the interactions of tumor cell and stromal cells in co-cultures. The developed in silico tools are versatile enough to be adjusted to other organoid cultures, other tumor tissues and other components of the tumor microenvironment to generate testable hypotheses about tumor progression and response to treatments.

I will show how this can be tackled mathematically studying how mRNA fluctuations are influenced by DNA replication and cell cycle duration stochasticity. Results show that omitting cell cycle details can introduce significant errors in the predicted mean and variance of gene expression for prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, reaching 25% error in the variance for mouse fibroblasts. Furthermore, we derive a negative binomial approximation to the mRNA distribution, indicating that cell cycle stochasticity introduces similar fluctuations to bursty transcription. Finally, I will show how disregarding cell cycle stochasticity can introduce inference errors in transcription rates bigger than 10%.

We study their joint evolution in a structured metapopulation model with a continuous distribution of habitats. Habitat choice follows as the outcome of dispersal with non-random immigration, a process always acknowledged yet rarely incorporated into theoretical models. For fixed local adaptation, we find the evolutionarily stable habitat choice as a function linking the probability of settlement to the local environment. When the local adaptation trait co-evolves, the metapopulation can become polymorphic. Our main result shows that coexisting strains with only slightly different local adaptation traits evolve substantially different habitat choice. In turn, different habitat use selects for divergent local adaptations. We thus propose that the joint evolution of habitat choice and local adaptation can facilitate niche expansion via diversification under wide conditions, also when the local adaptation trait evolving alone would attain an ESS restricted to a narrower niche.

Longer maturation time resulting in stronger adult predator allows the predator to improve predation ability, reduce handling time and increase survival probability. To understand whether two predators can attain a stable coexistence via evolutionary branching of maturation time, we apply the method of critical function analysis to construct three different types of trade-off functions between maturation time with predator's capture rate, handling time and death rate, respectively. A new method to calculate the invasion fitness is applied in non-equilibrium dynamics. Evolutionary branching of maturation time is possible in the cases of capture rate and handling time. The coexistence of two predators induced by branching is evolutionarily stable. In the case of death rate, the monomorphic predator population can evolve to an evolutionarily stable strategy.

Our focus is on the Prisoners’ Dilemma: a game in which individuals are best off cheating, while groups of individuals do best when composed of many cooperators. We analyze the dynamics of the two-level replicator dynamics, a nonlocal hyperbolic PDE describing deterministic birth-death dynamics for both individuals and groups. Comparison principles and an invariant property of the tail of the population distribution are used to characterize the threshold level of between-group selection dividing a regime in which the population converges to a delta function at the equilibrium of the within-group dynamics from a regime in which between-group competition facilitates the existence of steady-state densities supporting greater levels of cooperation. In particular, we see that the threshold selection strength and average payoff at steady state depend on a tug-of-war between the individual-level incentive to be a defector in a many-cooperator group and the group-level incentive to have many cooperators over many defectors. We also find that lower-level selection casts a long shadow: if groups are best off with a mix of cooperators and defectors, then there will always be fewer cooperators than optimal at steady state, even in the limit of infinitely strong competition between groups.

The competitive exclusion principle states that in a constant population two species competing for the same limited resource cannot coexist. This cannot be generalised to non-constant populations. In particular, it has been shown that two predator species competing for the same niche can coexist if the population exhibits non-equilibrium dynamics such as limit cycles. In addition to the ecological question, there emerges the problem whether the coexistence of different predator types competing for a single prey is evolutionarily robust and attainable. Geritz et al. [1] used the theory of adaptive dynamics to study the evolution of the handling time in a model with Holling type II functional response. They found that under certain conditions the handling time undergoes evolutionary branching and leads to the establishment of the evolutionarily robust coexistence of two predator types. Essential is the assumption of a trade-off between the handling time and the conversion factor connecting the predator's birth rate to its capture rate. It was found that the predator type with the short handling time dominates in the part of the population cycle where the prey is abundant, while the other type prevails when the prey is rare. Ecologically this makes sense: when the prey density is low, prospects of capturing new prey are diminished and it becomes worthwhile to cling to the prey one has already got despite of its gradually decreasing returns. When the prey is common, however, it is easy to replace the partially spent prey by a new one. In this presentation we derive a Holling type II functional response with handling time that depends on the prey density. The ecological setting raises some considerations on the importance of the mechanistic approach when we look at the functions which model the population dynamics as well as leads to new interesting evolutionary questions. Using the theory of adaptive dynamics, we investigate if at least some level of density dependence is favoured whether or not the population is cycling. A further question is if the density dependence can eliminate the possibility of coexistence of different predator types. This makes sense when a single predator with density dependent handling time dynamically shifts its niche between low and high prey densities depending on the phase of the population cycle in a way that a predator with a fixed handling time cannot.

The migration of each organism can be rationalized as a trade-off between growth and survival with strategies as spatial distributions of the populations. The dynamics driving vertical migration have broad implications for fluxes through the food-web predator-pray interactions [2, 4]; for vertical transport of carbon from upper to deeper layers (i. e. the so-called 'biological carbon pump') with implications for global climate. Here, we present progress of ongoing work on a framework for expressing diel vertical migration as a 'vertical game' in terms of partial differential equations. In the model setup we consider a population of animals distributed in the water column. It is assumed that each animal in this game moves optimally, seeking regions with high growth rate and small mortality, avoiding regions with high population density. The Nash equilibrium for this mean field game is characterized by a system of partial differential equations, which governs the population distribution and migration velocities of animals. The derived system of PDEs has similarities to equations that appear in the fluid dynamics, specifically the Euler equations for compressible inviscid fluids. For the established framework we derive a discretized system of equations to solve the PDEs governing this game theoretical model and present results of numerical simulations. The discretization process is based on the spectral collocation method which has exponential convergence rate for smooth enough functions compared to finite difference schemes. This allows us to reduce computational complexity of the discrete version of PDEs.  Recent results either doesn't take into account cost of movement [4] or doesn't resolve time continuously [2]. We formulate the equations in continuous time, incorporate costs on excessive movements in our model and illustrate the theory with numerical examples.

Adequate immune cell motility is necessary to clear infections. The motility of cells is affected by interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as by chemoattractants and other molecular signals. To study cell-ECM interactions, we consider two situations that we study using a combination of experiments and mathematical modeling. These two environmental cues are also present for in vivo immune cells as they move through tissue filled with other cells and ECM. First is topotaxis where cell motion is guided by the topography of the environment. As a model of amoeboid cell motility through pores in the ECM, we study the motility of Dictyostelium discoideum cells on a substrate covered with microscopic pillars. The pillars are spaced widely enough to let the cells through and there is a gradient from densely packed pillars to more widely spaced pillars. Here the cells perform a random walk with a slight drift to the more widely spaced area. Using a Cellular Potts model, we study how cell persistence mode affect topotaxis using the actin-derived persistence of the Act-model and an active Brownian particle-based persistence. We find that both modes result in topotactic drift comparable to the experimentally found drift, but the actin-based persistent cells show a more efficient drift. Next we study how ECMs of more dense structure affect the motility of B-lymphocytes. B-lymphocytes show different motitility modes on different matrices: a slow but persistent random walk on collagen IV with low cell-ECM contact area and a faster Brownian walk on fibronectin with high cell-ECM contact area. Expanding the Act-model with cell-ECM bonds that can form, grow and shrink, and rupture, we can obtain different cell motion with by using different rupture energies and new bond formation. Simulated cells mostly show a persistent random walk, with low persistence and low diffusivity for poorly attached cells, and high persistence and high diffusivity for dynamically attached cells. Cells with sustained attachement show pivoting behaviour which was persistent in short time-scales, but subdiffusive on long time scales. We conclude that cell-ECM interactions can affect cell motility in multiple ways. ECM pores can steer cells from denser to looser ECM areas through topotaxis, whereas attachment to the ECM can alter the motility type of cells. Combined, these cues could lead to a range of different possible motility types. How in vivo cells integrate these cues together with other cues such as chemokine signalling is subject for further studies.

The assays are commonly used to quantify the rate of gap closure, which is a measure of the speed of the collective motion of cells and they are able to evaluate cell migration usefully in vitro wound healing. Obviously, the actual wound is more complex than the wound is done by making a scratch on a cell monolayer, however; the scratch wound assay is a technically simple, inexpensive, and fast method for analysis of cell migration and does allow modeling and testing of cell migration under well-defined conditions. We introduce a novel continuum model that extended the derived continuous model of a single population of cells. To derive our continuum model, we consider an integro-advection-diffusion-reaction equation for the adhesion of the single-cell motility in one dimension.  And in this specific study, we analyse the applicability of our model to scratch-wound healing assay based on some experimented cases.

It is important to understand the molecular activity that allows some cells to assume the migratory cell fate.  The critical interaction we consider, in Drosophila melanogaster, is between the well-conserved Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) and downstream transcription factors Apontic (APT) and Slow Border Cells (SLBO).  We derive a detailed mechanistic mathematical model and then reduce it to the three main transcription factors.  The reduction maintains the steady state behavior including a bistable switch between stationary and migratory states.  However, the basins of attraction vary, and the manifolds separating the basins can be associated with delays in cell fate decisions.  Experiments with miRNA disruption of cell migration compare well with the equivalent model manipulation.

They need to determine the direction and position of sources releasing diffusing molecular guidance cues from information gathered by receptors located on the cell membrane. Using matched asymptotics, we developed a model that relates the chemical fluxes to receptors to the gradient source position. We learned that simple direction sensing using comparison of fluxes is strongly limited. In contrast, full recovery of the gradient source position from receptor fluxes is possible even over relatively large distances. We quantify the uncertainty associated with location triangulation and show how the accuracy depends on the number and distribution of receptors.

Conversely, in cases in which pathogenic or excess IgG antibodies are the aetiological agents, it is desirable to lower the IgG levels, in order to alleviate the symptoms; as in autoimmune diseases. One of the most efficient approaches to decrease the pathogenic IgG levels is to enhance its catabolism by administering recombinant IgG, which competes with the endogenous for the binding to the FcRn receptor. It was shown experimentally that the administration of exogenous IgG with high affinity, delivers better results in enhancing the degradation of the endogenous pathogenic IgG, than the classical intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment, which is only effective in high doses. In this study, the competing interactions of the exogenous IgG and endogenous (pathogenic) IgG, when binding with the FcRn receptor are analyzed, on the basis of the model proposed in. A multi- scale analysis is carried out by employing the Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) algorithmic methodology. With this algorithm, the constraints that develop progressively, form the start of the process to the fixed point, are identified, along with the reduced model that governs the evolution of the system within these constraints. CSP provides the tools for system-level understanding, by identifying the physical processes that (i) contribute to the emergence of the constraints (equilibria), (ii) drive the slow evolution of the system within these constraints and (iii) are responsible for the development of the fast and slow timescales in the dynamics of the model. The objective of this manuscript is to provide meaningful insights regarding the dynamical properties of the competitive binding of the endogenous and exogenous IgG with the FcRn receptor. Given that the modulation of the IgG-FcRn interaction allows for the control of the IgG half- life, the analysis provides a guideline to engineer effective recombinant IgG antibodies, in order to reduce the endogenous IgG levels.

Deuterium labelling experiments are often used to infer the kinetic properties (i. e. , turnover rates, maintenance mechanisms) of various cell populations in vivo. For a homogeneous population that is at steady state, it is natural to expect that the population gains and loses labelled cells at the same rate. However, if the measured population is kinetically heterogeneous, it is natural to expect that the rate at which the labeling curve increases (i. e. , the up-slope) is slower than the rate at which it decreases (i. e. , the down-slope). Surprisingly, recent data from multiple deuterium-labelling experiments have the opposite property, and predict a gain of label that is faster than the rate of loss. Using various mathematical models, we search for mechanisms that can account for such unexpected labelling data. We show that the short-term labeling data can be explained when the deuterium remains available for a longer duration than it was administered. For the long-term labeling data we study models where (a) the population was considered to behave like a stem-cell population, or (b) the phases of the cell cycle were modeled with delay equations (i. e. , with the Smith-Martin model). Both provide scenarios where the gain of label can be faster than its loss. However, the effect is small and these two models fail to give a good description of the experimental data. When we finally drop the assumption that the population remains at steady state, we readily explain the experimental data with a simple source, division and death model. This mechanism however requires that these populations are largely expanding by a source from a precursor compartment, and not by cell division (i. e. , self-renewal).

However, in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that cellular coin- fection occurs frequently in influenza, HIV, and coronaviruses, among other viral pathogens. Here, I first discuss work from my group that develops simple models that allow for cellular coinfection in a scalable manner, with cellular multiplicity of infection affecting the phenotypes of infected cells, such as their death rate, viral production rate, and interferon induction rate. I then present work focusing on quantitatively characterizing the evolutionary consequences of cellular coinfection for newly arising mutations (both beneficial and deleterious). Our findings indicate that cellular coinfection decreases the ability of selection to act on individual mutations and results in genetic drift playing a larger role in modulating allele frequencies in a within-host viral population.

A small initial number of bacteria enter host cells and proliferate inside them, eventually destroying the host cell and releasing numerous copies that infect other cells. Our analysis of disease progression is based on a stochastic model of a population of infectious agents inside one host cell, extending the birth-and-death process by the occurrence of catastrophes: cell rupture events that affect all bacteria in a cell simultaneously. Closed expressions are obtained for the survival function of an infected macrophage, the number of bacteria released as a function of time after infection, and total bacterial load. We compare our analysis with the results of agent-based computation and, via Approximate Bayesian Computation, with experimental measurements carried out after of murine aerosol infection with the virulent SCHU S4 strain of the bacterium. The posterior distribution is consistent with the estimate that the time between rounds of bacterial division is less than 6 hours in vivo.

MAC-pulmonary disease is difficult to treat and prone to recurrence, and both incidence and prevalence are increasing. MAC form biofilms and diverse colonies in the environment. These biofilms can aid in epithelial cell invasion, cause premature apoptosis in macrophages, and inhibit antibiotic efficacy [4]. We hypothesize a balance of bacterial factors (phenotypic diversity and biofilm formation) and host immune factors (speed and magnitude of response) is key to establishing and prolonging infections in the lung. To test these hypotheses, we developed a 3D agent-based model (ABM) that incorporates known interactions between bacteria, biofilm and immune cells in virtual lung tissue. We implement our model in Repast Simphony. The simulation grid represents a length of lung airway with a layer of mucus. Bacterial agents are classified as either sessile or planktonic phenotypes that determine their behavior: biofilm formation, macrophage phagocytosis and replication rate. All bacterial agents and infected macrophages release a generic chemoattractant representing pathogen associated molecular patterns and chemokines respectively. These chemoattractants diffuse through the grid and are treated as continuous variables. Macrophages probabilistically follow the chemoattractant gradient, phagocytose bacteria, and accumulate apoptotic signals (representing hyperstimulation in the TNF-α pathway) through exposure to biofilm and internal bacteria. Model results show an early relationship between the initial number of macrophages or distance that chemoattractants diffuse, and the ratio of planktonic to sessile bacteria. Larger initial macrophage numbers result in a stronger and more sustained reduction in planktonic bacteria early after infection. However, as the infection progresses, the bacterial population is sustained by the sessile bacteria that are protected in biofilms or inside infected macrophages, allowing the planktonic population to recover. This effect is offset with further chemoattract diffusion, as the macrophages can clear the infection early or recruit more macrophages. Thus, the model predicts that both bacterial phenotypes and a suppressed immune responses affect the bacterial ability to survive, propagate, and eventually establish infection. Future directions of this work include exploring the continued role of phenotypes later in infection and treatment, and adding drug pharmacokinetics and cell-level pharmacodynamics to better understand the role of biofilm in treatment efficacy.

On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25th January. By 4th February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill passengers were implemented. By 20th February, 619 of 3700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive. Methods: We estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of the outbreak using SEIR models. We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data. We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups. We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship. Results: The basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the R0 in the epicentre in Wuhan, but the countermeasures lowered it substantially. Based on the modeled initial R0 of 14. 8, we estimated that without any interventions within the time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have been infected. Isolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and lowered the ${R}_0$ to 1. 78. We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers on 3 February would have been associated with 76 infected persons in their incubation time. Conclusions: The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease. The public health measures prevented more than 2000 additional cases compared to no interventions. However, evacuating all passengers and crew early on in the outbreak would have prevented many more passengers and crew from infection.

Interventions aimed at travellers, such as syndromic screening, sensitisation to symptoms, and contact tracing on onset of symptoms may help delay the establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. Here we consider how the probability of detecting an infected traveller varies with the sensitivity of screening and duration of travel relative to the incubation period. We also show how a combination of these traveller interventions may be effective at delaying the establishment early on in a global outbreak but become less effective as the rate at which infected travellers arrive increases.

The subsequent spread, rapid control measures, and reported international cases caused global public health concern. The scientific community responded rapidly, sharing data for modelling and estimation, and sharing viral sequences. These strongly suggested that there was a single introduction event from an animal reservoir to humans in approximately November 2019. However, key epidemiological parameters remained uncertain even in late February, as reporting fractions and social distancing measures varied between places, and because the time at which an individual is infected is of course unknown. We present early estimates of the incubation period and serial interval for several reported clusters, using contact tracing data. We describe the differences in model predictions based on these estimates and early models based on SARS parameters. We then discuss how early viral sequences and classic epidemiological estimates of key parameters can be integrated to refine estimates and inform transmission models.

This approach may provide key insights for the mechanistic differences between two motors that are believed to maintain the rings at a constant diameter. In particular, we develop methods leveraging topological data analysis techniques to investigate time-series data of filament interactions. Our proposed methods clearly reveal the impact of kinetic parameters on significant topological hole formation, thus giving insight into ring channel formation and maintenance.

In the present work, BINNs are trained in a supervised learning framework to approximate in vitro cell biology assay experiments while respecting a generalized form of the governing reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE). By allowing the diffusion and reaction terms to be multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), the nonlinear forms of these terms can be learned while simultaneously converging to the solution of the governing PDE. Further, the trained MLPs are used to guide the selection of biologically interpretable mechanistic forms of the PDE terms which provides new insights into the biological and physical mechanisms that govern the dynamics of the observed system.

To classify the emergent collective motion in a large library of numerical simulations and to recover model parameters from the simulation data, we apply machine learning techniques to two different types of input. First, we input time series of order parameters traditionally used in studies of collective motion. Second, we input measures based on topology that summarize the time-varying persistent homology of simulation data over multiple scales. This topological approach does not require prior knowledge of the expected patterns. For supervised machine learning methods for classification of mechanistic model parameters, the topological approach outperforms the one that is based on traditional order parameters.

We will present applications of a 3D multiscale hybrid discrete-continuum model to simulate angiogenesis and vascular tumour growth. The model uses a cellular automaton approach and couples intracellular dynamics, active cell movement, cell- cell interaction, extracellular diffusion, and a dynamically evolving vascular network. The model accounts for the interplay between subcellular events and the macroscopic properties of the tumour. Simulation of larger tumours taking into account the structure of the tissue and blood supply consisting of millions of interacting cells, and the architectures of real tissues, e. g. liver lobules, or validation of theoretical findings with aid of imaging and simulations of therapies for larger patient communities, are both compu- tationally challenging. Therefore, we will introduce new hardware and software developments applicable to multiscale modeling based on structural consistency between the multiscale model and the architecture of the computer hardware. These efficiently solve the problems of interactions between subcellular and tissue levels. I will summarize multicellular simulators based on hybrid structures of parallelised graphic and central processors. I will present applications of these hybrid parallelised computer systems to integrate simulation of 3D-growth of larger vascularized tumours, dynamic models of intracellular metabolism of hepatocytes, and the the 3D architecture of liver lobules.

The model describes tumour and normal cells nested in a vascular system that changes structure in response to tumour-related growth factors and also interacts with oxygen that influences cell viability. Within the extended model TACE is included as a two-step process. First, the purely mechanical influence of the embolisation therapy is modelled by a local occlusion of the tumour vasculature. We distinguish between partial and complete responders, where parts of the vascular system are occluded for the former and the whole tumour vasculature is destroyed for the latter. In the second part of the model, drug eluting beads release the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin at destroyed vascular locations. Simulation results are parameterised to qualitatively reproduce clinical observations. Our simulations reveal that directly after a TACE treatment an unstable tumour state can be observed, where regrowth and total tumour death are equally likely. This short time-window is favorable for another therapeutic intervention with a less radical therapy. This procedure produces a more favorable outcome. Simulation results with an oxygen therapy within the unstable time- window demonstrate a potentially positive manipulated outcome. Finally, we conclude that our TACE model motivates new therapeutic strategies and can help clinicians to understand intertwined relations and crosstalk in tumours.

However, these assays generally use cell-death as an endpoint, which is more suited to simple cytotoxicity than to anti-cancer efficacy. This is especially a challenge in the context of combination therapies, where the correct linkage function in a statistical model of two co-administered cytotoxic compounds is not obvious. Therefore, we propose imaging-based and molecular markers of cancer cell phenotype, as an alternative efficacy endpoint in cancer drug screening. We will combine and compare results in combination therapy screens with different efficacy measures and a range of linkage functions corresponding to different assumptions on the nature of cancer drug synergy. These approaches have the added benefit of better addressing inter-cellular heterogeneity, which is evident even in clonal cell lines.

In particular, we use experimental data to infer distributions on parameters that are critical to tumor growth and to the resultant immune response of the body.

The origin and maintenance of diversity in nature are central themes in evolutionary biology and ecology. Recently, the framework of adaptive dynamics has been applied to try and shed light onto these questions, with interesting results. The phenomenon of disruptive selection when extreme phenotypes have a fitness advantage over more intermediate phenotypes is particularly interesting because, under this regime, selection favors the evolution of adaptive phenotypic diversity. More specifically, it can drive speciation as well as the evolution and maintenance of polymorphism within a species. The conditions that result in this specific selective regime are well understood at the theoretical level, but with one fun- damental restriction: the majority of research is based on the assumption of a single evolving quantitative trait. However, biological organisms are complex and initial results from the few models that incorporate multidimensional trait evolution indicate that increasing the number of co-evolving traits facilitates the emergence of disruptive selection. To systematically extend the existing theory, we study the conditions for the emergence of disruptive selection based on models with several co-evolving traits. These models are (i) characterized by a set of evolving traits that determines the fitness of individuals in a population due to interactions with a complex environment (prey, predators, pathogens), and (ii) mechanistic in the sense that each trait has an interpretation at the level of the organism. This approach thus allows us to better understand when and under what circumstances multiple coevolving traits facilitate or hinder the emergence of biological diversity. In this work, we analyze the evolutionary dynamics of consumer traits in a consumer-resource model. Consumer growth depends on search efficiency, handling time and conversion efficiency for two resources. Feeding on these alternative resources is subject to trade-offs such that, for instance, increasing search efficiency for one resource can only be achieved by decreasing search efficiency for the other. We investigate the evolution of these traits in isolation and various combinations. Our results show how moving from one to two, and then three coevolving traits affects the conditions un- der which resource polymorphism arises through evolutionary branching. We also show that the critical trade-off curvatures that lead to the different evolutionary outcomes that is, whether evolution leads to one generalist, one specialist or two specialists depend decisively on the specific combination of coevolv- ing traits. Finally, we show that, with multidimensional trait spaces, the parameter range can be split into one region in which evolutionary branching is independent of the mutational variance-covariance matrix, and another in which branching depends on it.

Most empirical studies still focus on the ecological consequences of evolutionary change within a single species. However, in natural systems species co-occur together, comprising a community. Hence, all member species may display an evolutionary response. Thus focusing on evolution of a single species may lead to an over- or underestimation of evolution on ecological processes. To understand the role of eco-evolutionary dynamics within communities of multiple coexisting species, there is a need for a formal theory of eco-evolutionary communities integrating processes of evolutionary biology and community ecology operating at different temporal and spatial scales. Based on previous frameworks of evolutionary biology and community ecology, I here present an integrated framework for eco-evolutionary communities, bringing together theoretical, conceptual and technical approaches of these two fields. Integrating fundamental processes of evolutionary biology and community ecology improves our understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics within multi-species communities and allows the design of new experimental approaches and testing for new hypotheses.

Where these modifications influence the fitness of conspecifics, a feedback emerges between the evolution of traits and the environment in which they are expressed. To investigate such feedback, it is typically assumed that individuals interact at random. In this case, one can study the invasion of a rare mutant trait in an environment set by a common resident ignoring mutant-mutant interactions. However, non-random interactions are common in nature. In this talk, I will report some of my results on the effect of non-random interactions on eco-evolutionary dynamics, focusing on two mechanisms that lead to such non-random interactions: spatial structure and biased behaviours between parents and their offspring. In both cases, selection depends on complex feedbacks between individuals of the same mutant lineage. By disentangling and quantifying these feedbacks, this research can help understand the nature of adaptation via non-genetic modifications, with implications for how organisms evolve to transform their environments, microbiome, or culture.

Hypercycles are dynamical systems formed by replicators with catalytic activity, thus they have been also employed to investigate cooperation in complex ecosystems at different levels. Following this mathematical model, we will show the dynamics and bifurcations tied to cooperation, from origins of life to models of facilitation in metapopulations and dynamics of semiarid ecosystems. We will emphasise on the evidences we have of such dynamics in real biological systems (both at the experimental or field levels), thus showing that dynamical systems theory offers us a unique framework to understand the basic mechanims behind the dynamics and the transitions in systems with strong nonlinearities.

Some species, however, may be able to escape that fate by adapting, shifting their geographical ranges, or both. This leads to the questions of when, where and how might adaptation allow species to survive, leading to ‘evolutionary rescue’. Some basic answers to those questions come from theory. Experimental and theoretical studies have highlighted the impact of gene flow on the probability of evolutionary rescue. Mathematical modelling and simulations of evolutionary rescue in spatially or otherwise structured populations showed that intermediate migration rates can often maximise the probability of rescue in gradually or abruptly deteriorating habitats. In this talk, I present several mathematical approaches to studying evolutionary rescue in spatial or otherwise structured populations with gene flow between sub-populations, using discrete or continuous space models. I present simple conditions for when gene flow facilitates evolutionary rescue as compared to isolated populations, investigate the role of long-distance dispersal, as well as the role of phenotypic variation in dispersal traits.

Recent studies have shown that a treatment strategy aiming for containment, not elimination, can control tumour burden more effectively than more aggressive approaches in vitro, in mouse models, and in the clinic, but theoretical understand- ing of these outcomes is underdeveloped. I will present a new, mathematically rigorous framework for understanding tumour containment that unifies and generalizes previous formulations. Results obtained within this framework provide timely guidance for empirical research including the design of clinical trials.

Many plasmids have a copy number greater than one such that the genes encoded on these plasmids are present in multiple copies per cell. This has evolutionary consequences by increasing the mutational target size, by prompting the (transitory) co-occurrence of mutant and wild-type alleles within the same cell, and by allowing for gene dosage effects. We present a mathematical model for bacterial adaptation to harsh environmental change if adaptation is driven by beneficial alleles on multicopy plasmids. Successful adaptation depends on the availability of advantageous alleles and on their establishment probability. The establishment process involves the segregation of mutant and wild-type plasmids to the two daughter cells, allowing for the emergence of mutant homozygous cells over the course of several generations. To model this process, we use the theory of multi-type branching processes, where a type is defined by the genetic composition of the cell. Both factors – the availability of advantageous alleles and their establishment probability – depend on the plasmid copy number, and they often do so antagonistically. We find that in the interplay of various effects, a lower or higher copy number may maximize the probability of evolutionary rescue. The decisive factor is the dominance relationship between mutant and wild-type plasmids and potential gene dosage effects. Results from a simple model of antibiotic degradation indicate that the optimal plasmid copy number may depend on the specific environment encountered by the population.

It is well known that time delays may cause oscillations. Here we report a novel behavior. We show that a microscopic model of evolutionary games with a unique mixed evolutionarily stable strategy (a globally asymptotically stable interior stationary state in the standard replicator dynamics) and with strategy-dependent time delays leads to a new type of replicator dynamics. It describes the time evolution of fractions of the population playing given strategies and the size of the population. Unlike in all previous models, stationary states of such dynamics depend on time delays. Moreover, at certain time delays, an interior stationary state may disappear or there may appear another interior stationary state. This shows that effects of time delays are much more complex then it was previously thought. 									  											  									  									  								  								  								  								  								  								  						  										 						 																		 		  				 		  				  			             		    		  									                15 minute break (11:00-11:15am)                								  		    		      		        Sub-group minisymposia (11:15am)		        			  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				 		  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				 		  																																		 	CDEV: Shapes, patterns, and forces in development biology (11:15am-12:45pm)													 						  			  				  							  							  										  									  	Steffen Rulands								  	 								  		Max Planck Institute								  									  									  										  			&lt;/br&gt; Setting up the epigenome: a collective phenomenon 								  										  									  									  										  										  											  			Methods from single-cell multi-omics allow measuring several layers of regulation along the one- dimensional sequence of the DNA. The biological function of these processes relies, however, on emergent processes in the three-dimensional space of the nucleus, such as droplet formation through phase sepa- ration. How can measurements along the sequence of the DNA be translated into an understanding of emergent dynamics in nuclear space? Here, we combine single-cell NMT-sequencing experiments with a theoretical and computational approach to rigorously map measurements along the DNA sequence to a description of the emergent spatial dynamics in the nucleus. Drawing on scNMT-seq experiments in vitro and in vivo we demonstrate our approach in the context of early development. We show how epigenetic modifications of the DNA, DNA methylation, are established through the interplay between chemical and topological modifications of the DNA, leading to the formation of condensates of methylated DNA in the nucleus. Using this theoretical framework, we finally identify epigenetic processes that precede lineage decisions in the early embryo. Our work sheds new light on epigenetic mechanisms involved in cellular decision making. It also provides a general framework of how mechanistic insights into the spatio-temporal processes governing cell-fate decisions can be gained by the combination of methods from single-cell multi-genomics, computational biology and theoretical physics.

Using standard viscoelastic models involving combinations of spring and dashpot elements to capture this behaviour oversimplifies the response; this limits our ability to adequately quantify the characteristics of these materials. Alternatively, empirical expressions designed to fit the power-law behaviour may provide effective means to describe experimental measurements, but the use of such ad-hoc models without a proper constitutive relationship limits the scope of the measurements and restricts their predictive capability. Fractional calculus provides a convenient framework to accurately capture power-law behaviours. Various empirical expressions introduced to fit experimental data can be derived or approximated with simple fractional models, often using fewer parameters. Furthermore, this approach seems to be well suited to extract material properties. As we demonstrated in the context of single cells and simple tissues, fitting a model on one set of experiments, can be used to predict the response of the same material to a broad range of external stimuli. Furthermore, using consistent models accross various experimental measurement methods enables us to compare material parameters that could not be easily compared otherwise. This allows us to shed new light on behaviour previously reported in the literature. Fractional calculus is a niche area of mathematics that has been available for a long time in the literature. It has to date attracted limited attention in the biological field, or any other area due to the mathematical complexity. To promote the use of such generalised fractional viscoelastic models, we provide an open source library RHEOS for numerical analysis of experimental data. The occurrence of such power-law behaviour also in non-living tissues, e. g. gels, casein, plants; implies that fractional viscoelastic models can have a great impact on.

At the core of these models are the numerical scheme used to update cell positions and the force functions that encode the pairwise mechanical interactions of cells. For the latter there are multiple choices that could potentially affect both the biological behavior captured, and the robustness and efficiency of simulation. For example, available open-source software implementations of center-based models rely on different force functions for their default behavior and it is not straightforward for a modeler to know if these are interchangeable. Our study addresses this problem and contributes to the understanding of the potential and limitations of three popular force functions from a numerical perspective. We show empirically that choosing the force parameters such that the relaxation time for two cells after cell division is consistent between the different force functions results in good agreement of the population radius of a growing monolayer. Furthermore, we report that numerical stability is not sufficient to prevent unphysical cell trajectories following cell division, and consequently, that too large time steps can cause geometrical differences at the population level. We illustrate that the different force functions show varying sensitivity to this issue.

The tubes of the Drosophila salivary gland result from the organization and collective motion of a flat sheet of polarized epithelial cells through a budding process. Through orchestrated cell movements and cell rearrangements, the nascent tube begins to form. In this talk, we develop a novel 3D-vertex model that allows for the investigation and quantification of the role that cellular mechanics and cellular rearrangements play during this vital morphogenetic process. The novel 3D model is able to quantify cell mechanical behavior and analyze the effect of different forces during invagination. Using this biophysical model, we investigate how patterning of forces on the apical surface cause cell shape changes that lead to invagination.  Specifically, we investigate the roles of apicomedial induced cellular constriction, junctional actomyosin, a supracellular actomyosin cable and cellular intercalations have during gland morphogenesis.

However recent observations indicate that functional cure, i. e. , control of HIV infection in absence of ART, is possible. Treatment strategies to achieve functional cure have therefore become a very active area of research. The efforts to develop a functional cure for HIV-1 must overcome the persistence of the latent reservoir of infected CD4+ T cells. These cells contain integrated HIV-1 DNA and are both long-lived and can re-active producing new viral particles that re-establish infection after ART interruption. All progress towards a HIV-1 cure must contend with this problem. Proposed strategies for curing HIV-1 include methods to reduce the size of the reservoir, or induce immune responses that can prevent viral rebound after ART interruption. Such novel treatments are typically tested in the macaque model or in humanized mice. We analyze data from two such studies: a macaque model to assess the effect of early ART initiation, which may limit latent reservoir size, and a CD4+ T-cell xenograft mouse model to assess the effect of immuno-therapies targeted at HIV-specific CD8+ T cells (HSTs). Stochasticity plays a major role in both these experiments. The formation of the latent reservoir and reactivation from this reservoir leading to viral rebound are both thought to be highly stochastic processes. In the mouse model, the virus escapes from the CD8+ T-cell immune response in a largely unpredictable manner, despite the fact that biological variation between repeated experiments is reduced to a minimum. We are therefore motivated to develop stochastic viral dynamics models to describe the data, rather than the standard deterministic viral dynamics model, and further, we estimate parameters using Sequential Monte Carlo methods for panel data. This allows us to integrate data from repeated experiments in our inference. In our investigation of early SIV infection with macaque data, we compare different models of reservoir formation. We show that a model in which reservoir establishment saturates at high viral loads, can reconcile early establishment with the observed distribution of rebound times. In our investigation of immuno-therapies with mouse data, we succeed in disentangling viral rebound due to escape from the HST response, from rebound due to typical expansion and contraction dynamics of the HSTs.

Therapies with the RNA interfer- ence drug ARC-520, which silence viral translation, together with daily administration of the nucleoside analogue drug entecavir have showed reduction in the overall levels of serum HBsAg in HBeAg-positive, treatment naive patients. Understanding the relative effects of ARC-520 alone, and in combination with entecavir, is particularly important in informing the development of new generation antiHBsAg drugs. A mathematical model describing the mechanistic interactions between HBV DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg in the presence of ARC-520 and entecavir has been developed. We fitted the model to patient data and investigated the long term dynamics of the virus and viral protein titers under entecavir alone and under combination therapy. We run in silico boosting experiments and used them to determine the tradeoff between viral protein decay and drug induced toxicity. Such results can inform policy.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is still one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in the world, with a disproportionate human and economic burden especially in poorer countries. Despite many years of intense research, an aspect that still is not well understood is what immune mechanisms control the viral load during the prolonged asymptomatic stage of infection. Because CD8+ T cells have been implicated in this control by multiple lines of evidence, there has been a focus on understanding the potential mechanisms of action of this immune effector population. One type of experiment used to this end has been depleting these cells with monoclonal antibodies in the SIV-macaque model and then studying the effect of that depletion on the viral dynamics. These experiments generated controversial results, with dynamical models developed to help interpret these data leading to conflicting conclusions. We propose a new explanation for these results and provide both new experimental data and modeling evidence that helps to reconcile previous observations. In this hypothesis the main effect of CD8+ T cells occurs before viral integration.

These recurrence of infection through hypnozoite activation is a major contributor to the total new infections in Plasmodium vivax endemic regions. After being treated for a single infection it is well known that some individuals will experience a second recurrence very rapidly while others will not experience a recurrence for some time. The mechanisms governing the ‘schedule’ of reactivation are not completely understood. A variety of conceptual models have been proposed, including a ‘biological clock’ mechanism, induction by external factors such as fever, or simply random reactivation of hypnozoites. In addition to these models, we propose an alternative explanation that there is heterogeneity in the risk of malaria relapse within the population. To explore the mechanisms governing P. vivax recurrence, we constructed differential equation models of each of the above conceptual models of hypnozoite reactivation. The models were compared, through fitting and simulation, to previously published time-to-infection data from a malaria endemic region following 1299 people for about one year. The data used in our study provided a powerful opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying P. vivax relapse because rather than including only a single infection event for each individual, multiple occurrences were recorded in many individuals over a one-year follow-up. However, the multiple measurements within each individual added complexity to fitting our custom time-to-infection model and required us to build these models within a mixed-effects type model framework. Our results show that the models with population heterogeneity in the reactivation rate provided the simplest and best explanation of the data and unlike the other conceptual models, heterogeneity could explain the observed patterns of P. vivax recurrences between individuals.

The risk of re-incursion is mitigated by strict quarantine requirements at the border. These measures include a mandatory 14-day stay in a government managed facility, multiple RT-PCR tests, and regular symptom checkups. We use a simple individual based model to investigate the risk that international arrivals pose. Arriving individuals are randomly assigned an infection status and, if relevant, an exposure date. False negative testing rates and infectiousness vary over time; while the asymptomatic status, symptom onset date, and daily contacts are assigned according to estimated distributions. Results suggest that minimising mixing in the facilities should be the primary focus of risk reduction efforts. We also propose a measure that can be used to estimate the level of transmission occurring within the facilities: the ratio of cases detected in their second week of stay to cases detected in their first week.

This change is driven by enhanced non-pharmaceutical interventions, in particular case isolation. We also show that using real-time estimation of serial intervals allowing for variation over time, provides more accurate estimates of reproduction numbers than using conventionally fixed serial interval distributions.

As part of social distancing measures enforced to tackle the epidemic, non-key workers were not allowed into the workplace and universities moved to online teaching and examination for the remainder of the 2019/2020 academic year. As steps are taken to relax social distancing measures, questions surround the ramifications on community disease spread of workers returning to the workplace and students returning to university. To study these aspects, we present a network model to capture the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 over four overlapping sets of networks: (i) fixed workplace contacts; (ii) social contacts; (iii) contacts at home; and (iv) dynamic workplace contacts (for workers who see people from multiple places, such as in the service sector). Additionally, we showcase the flexibility offered by the framework by describing its use in a university setting. We assess the impact of contact tracing adherence upon the spread of infection and the total number of individuals in isolation. We also consider the impact of backwards tracing, whereby resources are focused upon identifying the source of any reported infected cases, and larger scale isolation of portions of the population if case level alerts are triggered. Our results suggest that high adherence with contact tracing can result in a significant reduction in the number of infected individuals and the total number of people who would be required to isolate over the duration of the epidemic. We observe only a weak effect of backwards contact tracing - there is a slight reduction in epidemic size as the probability of successfully tracing the source of infection increases. Finally, we observe that, in order for reactive closures to be effective, such a policy needs to be enacted when only a small proportion of those that interact with that setting have recently begun to display symptomatic infection. We conclude that ensuring high adherence to contact tracing should be prioritised in order to reduce future infection levels.

In this talk, I will show how the epidemic risk was assessed in countries worldwide. I will also present a simple approach for extending this analysis for models in which additional epidemiological complexity is included (e. g. presymptomatic transmission, age-structure, time-varying infection rates). This shows how epidemic risk estimates can be generated, informed using outbreak data, and then adjusted in real-time as more information becomes available about any newly invading pathogen.

For instance, in a composite material composed of rigid interacting monodisperse particles randomly dispersed in a soft polymer matrix, the system experiences a phase transition at a critical particle density, whereas this transition may depend for instance on the mean number of filaments per contact in an actin network. This experimental phenomenon, termed rheological percolation, has been shown to occur in many systems at a density that is beyond the contact percolation threshold, demonstrating that a more complex mechanism is responsible for the observed mechanical gains. In this study, we construct a network model in which sphereocylinders are randomly dispersed in a medium and contact at intersection points (supposing penetrability). Idealizing these sphereocylinders (rods) as attractive particles that stay fixed at but can rotate about their points of contact (hinge-like connections), we posit that the rheological transition occurs when the rods form a spanning component that is not only connected, but connected in such a way as to remove all nontrivial degrees of freedom in the component (rigidity percolation). We build on results from two dimensions (see the paper https://epubs. siam. org/doi/abs/10. 1137/17M1157271) to develop an approximate algorithm that identiﬁes such spanning components through hierarchically identifying and compressing provably rigid motifs—contact patterns by which rigid components interact to form larger rigid components. We apply this algorithm to networks we generate at various density/system size, using a ﬁnite size scaling approach to rigorously estimate a rigidity percolation transition point bound, which we show agrees fairly well with a simple mean ﬁeld estimation. We also estimate the transition point (and critical exponents) for networks with different rod aspect ratios, and find that the transition point scales with the square of the aspect ratio.

The E50K OPTN mutation is associated with glaucoma.  Recent studies have shown that OPTN may play an important role in regulating mitochondrial networks and interacting with parkin as part of the mitophagy pathway.  We hypothesized that loss of normal OPTN function disrupts mitochondrial morphology.  To investigate and quantify the phenomena, we use multi-parameter persistent homology on confocal images of cells from transgenic mice with the E50K mutation and genetic knockout of optineurin.  In particular, we combine methods in mathematical morphology to form a multi-parameter filtration.  We will show that such filtration contains both topological and geometric information about the mitochondria, and will demonstrate ways to extract meaningful features from it.  Preliminary results support the hypothesis.  This is a joint work with Chuan-Shen Hu at National Taiwan Normal University, Emily Sun, and Dr. Henry C.

All these patterns form due to the interactions of pigment cells, which sort out through movement, birth, and competition during development. Using an agent-based approach, we have coupled deterministic cell migration by ODEs with stochastic rules for updating population size to reproduce stripe pattern development and predict cell interactions that may be altered in mutant patterns. Within a single zebrafish mutant, however, there is a lot of variability, and this makes it challenging to first identify the features of a pattern that we are trying to reproduce and then judge model success. Moreover, agent-based models have many parameters, and empirical descriptions of zebrafish patterns are largely qualitative. To help address these challenges, we draw on topological data analysis to develop a set of methods for automatically quantifying pattern features in a fully interpretable, cell-based way. We apply our techniques to both simulated data and real fish images, and we show how to quantitatively distinguish between and characterize different patterns.

There is mounting evidence for “prion-like” trans-neuronal transmission, whereby proteins misfold, trigger misfolding of adjacent same-species proteins, and there- upon cascade along neuronal pathways, giving rise to networked spread along white matter projections. The question of how protein aggregation and subsequent spread lead to stereotyped progression in the brain remains unresolved. We present here mathematically precise parsimonious modeling of these patho- physiological processes, extrapolated to the whole brain. We model monomer seeding and production at specific seed regions, aggregation using Smoluchowski equations; and networked spread using our prior Network-Diffusion model, whereby anatomic connections govern the rate at which two distant but con- nected brain regions can transfer pathologic proteins. These models involve several unknown parameters, some or all of which might be individual-specific. Hence parameter inference is a challenging problem, without which downstream applications of such models in disease diagnosis, prognosis and therapy will not be possible. We present several inference strategies we have explored in our lab, including nonlinear cost function minimization, variational Bayesian inference, and purely machine learning methods like support vectors and neural nets. Unlike most previous theoretical studies of protein aggregation, using these techniques our theoretical models are able to be fitted to and validated by experimental in vivo imaging and fluid protein measurements from large datasets.

Following typical parameter values in bacteria and cancer cell populations, we take the mutation rate to zero and the final number of cells to infinity. We prove that almost every site (entry of the sequence) is mutated in only a finite number of cells, and these numbers are independent across sites. However independence breaks down for the rare sites which are mutated in a positive fraction of the population. The model is free from the popular but disputed infinite sites assumption. Violations of the infinite sites assumption are widespread while their impact on mutation frequencies is negligible at the scale of population fractions. Some results are generalised to allow for cell death, selection, and site- specific mutation rates. To illustrate our results we estimate mutation rates in a lung adenocarcinoma.

An estimated 5% of these cancers are due to a hereditary cancer disposition caused by germline mutations in DNA repair genes. Mutation carriers have a greatly increased risk of developing cancer and therefore require intensified early detection measures. In order to precisely quantify the underlying cancer risks, to identify risk factors and to evaluate the benefit of early detection measures, two multi-centre interdisciplinary clinical registry studies have been established in Germany, which collect and analyse quality-controlled care data in a standardised manner. I will present selected results from the “German Consortium for Familial Intestinal Cancer” and the “German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer” which had a direct impact on future patient care. Example 1: Individuals with Lynch syndrome (LS) are at highly increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). Regular colonoscopic surveillance is recommended, but there is no international consensus on the appropriate interval. Comparing prospective data from three countries with different surveillance policies (annually, 1–2-yearly, 2–3-yearly), we found that a policy of strict annual colonoscopies was not associated with lower CRC incidence or stage. However, we could identify several factors suitable for risk stratification. This study led us to change our recommendations for colonoscopic surveillance of LS patients in Germany. Example 2: Individuals with high breast cancer risk are recommended to participate in an intensified multimodal breast imaging program. Using cohort data from 10 years of prospective surveillance we could confirm the importance of MRI in high-risk screening, compared with mammography and ultrasound. However, the efficacy of the program was limited with regard to high-risk patients without a predisposing germline mutation. Moreover, both from retrospective and prospective registry data we determined age-dependent breast cancer risks in different risk groups. As in example 1, these results also led to modifications of future clinical decision strategies. In conclusion, these examples demonstrate that specialized clinical- epidemiological registries provide an important means to generate evidence for the further development of risk-adapted early cancer de- tection strategies. The registries are also a valuable basis for planning and conducting controlled clinical trials.

Like many other tumors, Lynch syndrome cancers develop through multiple pathways incorporating different driver mutations. However, a comprehensive understanding of LS tumor evolution which allows for tailored clinical interventions for treatment and even prevention is still lacking. We suggest a system of coupled ordinary differential equations modeling the evolution of the different pathways in order to address some of the most relevant unanswered questions in LS management. It is based on existing data on Lynch syndrome cancer incidence as well as mutational and molecular data for the individual pathways. The ansatz strikes a balance between being expressible on the one hand and not being too complex on the other hand. This yields an explainable and predictive behavior and makes the model amenable to a thorough mathematical analysis. It can be extended in a straightforward manner to include more mutated genes or to take new and improved measurements of mutation probabilities into account.

During life, somatic mutation events (second hits) lead to loss of MMR function in multiple crypts within the colonic mucosa. From thousands of such MMR-deficient crypt foci, however, only a very small part develops into clinically manifest cancers. These cancers are mostly diploid, but characterized by the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype, i. e. the accumulation of numerous insertion/deletion muta- tions at repetitive microsatellite sequences. Mutations affecting microsatellites in genes coding for tumor suppressor genes promote MSI tumor development in Lynch syndrome. Using a bioinformatics-based model, we have predicted a set of coding microsatellite mutations with likely driver function in Lynch syndrome. These mutations also lead to shifts of the translational reading frame and to the generation of MMR deficiency-related frameshift peptides (FSPs). The well-defined pattern of MMR deficiency- induced mutations and neoantigens has wide-ranging implications on the clinical course of the disease: as exactly the same mutations recurrently occur in exactly the same tumor suppressor genes, Lynch syndrome cancers share a small and predictable set of highly immunogenic FSP neoantigens. Immune responses against these FSP neoantigens can already be detected in tumor-free Lynch syndrome mutation carriers, suggesting that there is a lifelong interaction between the immune system and emerging precan- cerous cell clones. This is also reflected by the fact that immune-mediated elimination of immunogenic tumor cells leaves traces in manifest MSI cancers, a process termed immunoediting. We will discuss how bioinformatics approaches and mathematical modeling can help unraveling fundamental processes of cancer evolution, and how this information can be used to design novel, innovative approaches for cancer therapy and even prevention.

In thyasirid clams, it has been shown that trophic symbiosis can alter the energy allocation pattern of a host. However, the possible role of symbiosis as a life history strategy that can shape population dynamics remains unknown. Here, we show how nutritional symbiosis and the abundance of and dependence on symbionts can modulate the host's population dynamics and buffer resource limitation. We used Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory to build a physiologically-structured population model that explicitly includes energy acquisition and allocation at different stages of an organisms' life cycle. We formulated the model deriving the demographic rates from a DEB model and assuming equal mortality rates in both populations. We parameterized the model for two cohabiting clam species: asymbiotic (specialists that feed on free-living bacteria) and symbiotic thyasirids (generalists that gain nutrients from both free-living and symbiotic bacteria). We demonstrate that, without seasonal fluctuations, symbiotic thyasirids have higher abundances than asymbiotic thyasirids since the symbiotic bacteria act as an energy reserve allowing for higher energy allocation to reproduction. In a seasonal environment, when temperatures are low and resource is limiting, symbiotic and asymbiotic thyasirids have similar population sizes; nonetheless, the symbiotic population is less prone to extinction. Our findings suggest different adaptations to resource fluctuation: asymbiotic thyasirids depend on a larger energy reserve, while symbiotic thyasirids rely on symbiont assimilation. Our results highlight the relevance of linking individual energetics and life-history traits to population dynamics and are the first step towards a general understanding of the role of symbioses in populations' resilience.

Adults must attack a host simultaneously to overwhelm host defenses and successfully colonize. Temperatures directly but non-linearly affect MPB progress through life stages and the phenology of adult emergence. MPB are successful in a thermal niche where they are univoltine and synchronize emergence. Changing temperatures have broadened that niche geographically, leading to tree mortality of over 5. 2 Mha in the western US. Successful bivoltine MPB have not been observed in the field, although a phenology model parameterized for northern US MPB populations suggests bivoltinism is possible in the southern MPB range under future warming scenarios. Bivoltinism could have devastating impacts on pine forests. However, northern and southern MPB are genetically different in response to temperature, requiring geographic-specific model parameters. Using rate curves parameterized with developmental observations from MPB in Arizona we have constructed a predictive cohort model for a southern MPB population. Initiating the model with field attack data and using temperature data recorded under the bark of attacked hosts, we simulated warming scenarios by adding to the yearly mean to test thermal regimes that would result in a bivoltine MPB population. We successfully constructed a predictive cohort model for a southern MPB population. A key result is a new method for projecting observed variability in oviposition, through multiple larval instars, into emergence distributions. Comparison of the cohort model with field emergence data allows us to infer developmental rates for unwitnessed pre-ovipositional adults and also validate model predictions. Model responses to simulated temperatures highlight thermal regimes that promote bivoltinism for the southern MPB population.

One of the most widely used commercial products are arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, as these fungi can associate with a vast variety of crops. Despite the potential benefits for soil quality and crop yield associated with the use of AM fungi, experiments assessing the effective establishment of the fungi in the field have given inconsistent results, where some observations show field establishment and improved crop yield, while other studies show poor establishment of the inoculated species.  Additionally, it is not yet clear whether the introduction of commercial inoculants could lead to a biodiversity loss in the native fungal community, and ultimately have a negative impact on plant growth. Here we develop a series of ordinary and partial differential equation models to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of a guild of mutualists (the fungal species) sharing a resource provided by the same partner (the host plant), constituing a shared resource for all fungi. Our results allow to assess the risks and benefit of inoculation, by identifying under which conditions inoculation can effectively boost productivity, when it has no significant effect on plant growth and on the native fungal community, and when it represents an invasion risk.  More generally, our models provide important ecological insights into the mechanisms responsible for coexistence and competitive exclusion among mutualist guilds, and constitute a framework to predict the consequences of species manipulation in mutualist communities.  Indeed, the models are simple enough to apply to a broad range of mutualisms found in nature, such as pollination or seed dispersal.

Errors in segregating chromosomes during cell division are a hallmark of cancer and are associated with developmental syndromes. How cell division achieves high fidelity remains an outstanding question, in particular how errors are detected and corrected. Through automated tracking of chromosomes at fine spatio-temporal resolution over long timescales, we can produce detailed quantification of the behaviour of human cells during mitosis. We propose a force-based stochastic differential equation model, dependent on hidden states governed by a Markov process, to describe the oscillations and segregation of chromosomes in mitosis. By fitting this dynamic model to experimental data in a Bayesian framework, we can infer the timing of the metaphase-anaphase transition (chromosome separation) for each duplicated chromosome pair. By extending this to a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we are able to capture rare reversal events during anaphase in the model. Model comparison provides evidence that the hierarchical model with reversals is preferred over a model without reversals. Application of this computational modelling pipeline to experimental data allows characterisation of a distinct signature of model parameters related to lagging chromosomes, and subsequent correction of these errors by the cell.

The development of multicellular organisms is a dynamic process in which cells divide, rearrange, and interpret molecular signals to adopt specific cell fates. Despite the intrinsic stochasticity of cellular events, the cells identify their position within the tissue with striking precision of one cell diameter in fruit fly or three cell diameters in vertebrate spinal cord. How do cells acquire this positional information? How is this information encoded and how do cells decode it to achieve the observed level of cell fate reproducibility? These are fundamental questions in biology that are still poorly understood. In this talk, I will combine both information theory methods and mechanistic models to address these questions in the context of spinal cord development. I will consider the two opposing morphogen signals that are integrated to specify the arrayed pattern of neural progenitor domains that later on give raise to different type of neurons. Based on the maximum likelihood estimation rule I will define decoding map that provides predictions for shifts in the target gene domains in mutants. The predictions will be validated using experimental data obtained from naïve chick neural plate explants and from embryos with altered ventral morphogen signaling. I will present a simple model of a gene regulatory network that integrates the two morphogen signals and is sufficient to recapitulate the observed shifts in the target domains. I will investigate to what extent the level of noise in the input signals affects precision of the resulting gene expression pattern. Interestingly, the observed precision of gene expression pattern is close to the theoretical limit of precision of decoding of noisy signals.

During the first cell fate decision, cells become either part of an outer trophectoderm or part of the inner cell mass. Subsequently, the inner cell mass (ICM) segregates into the epiblast and the primitive endoderm, giving rise to the embryo and the placenta respectively. Recently, ICM organoids have been published as an in vitro model system towards preimplantational development. ICM organoids mimic the second cell fate decision taking place in the in vivo mouse embryos. In a previous study, the spatial pattern of the different cell lineage types was investigated. The study revealed that cells of the same fate tend to cluster stronger than expected for the currently hypothesised purely random cell fate distribution. Three major processes are hypothesised to contribute to the final cell fate arrangements at the mid and late blastocysts or 24 h old and 48 h old ICM organoids, respectively: 1) intra- and intercellular chemical signalling; 2) a cell sorting process; 3) cell proliferation.  Methods &amp; Results: In order to quantify the influence of cell proliferation on the emergence of the observed cell lineage type clustering behaviour, an agent-based model was developed. The model accounts for mechanical cell-cell interactions, cell growth and cell division and was applied to compare several current assumptions of how ICM neighbourhood structures are generated. The model supports the hypothesis that initial cell fate acquisition is a stochastically driven process, taking place in the early development of inner cell mass organoids. The model further shows that the observed neighbourhood structures can emerge due to cell fate heredity during cell division and allows the inference of a time point for the cell fate decision.  Discussion: Simulations based on the model show that cell divisions involving cell fate heredity seem sufficient to lead to the local clustering observed in 24 h old ICM organoids, and that the initial cell differentiation process takes place only during a small time window, during or prior to ICM organoid composition. Our results leave little room for extracellular signaling believed to be important in cell fate decision, therefore we are discussing an alternative role of chemical signaling in this process.

The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease.  In this talk, mathematical models will be introduced to represent SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in infected patients. Considering different starting times of infection, parameters sets that represent infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 are computed for the target cell limited model and compared with other viral infections that can also cause pandemics. The best model to fit the data was including immune cell response, which suggests a slow immune response peaking between 5 to 10 days post onset of symptoms. The model with eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported. Interestingly, both, the target cell limited model and the model including immune responses, predict that SARS-CoV-2 may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and it could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection.  These models can serve for future evaluation of control theoretical approaches to tailor new potential drugs against COVID-19.

A dysfunctional immune response, and the interaction with secreted cytokines (cytokine storm), has been observed to correlate with disease severity. However, the precise mechanisms which lead to disease severity remain unclear. In this talk, we employ a hybrid multi-scale individual-based model to study the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on an epithelial monolayer, its interaction with the host immune response and the immune cell cross-talk, as well as the interaction with secreted cytokines.

The host serine protease TMPRSS2 and cysteine proteases Cathepsin B/L can activate S, making two independent entry pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2. Blocking the proteases prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro. This blockade may be achieved in vivo through ‘repurposing’ drugs, a potential treatment option for COVID-19 that is now in clinical trials. Here, we found, surprisingly, that drugs targeting the two pathways, although independent, could display strong synergy in blocking virus entry. We predicted this synergy first using a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 entry and dynamics in vitro. The model considered the two pathways explicitly, let the entry efficiency through a pathway depend on the corresponding protease expression level, which varied across cells, and let inhibitors compromise the efficiency in a dose-dependent manner. The synergy predicted was novel and arose from effects of the drugs at both the single cell and the cell population levels. Validating our predictions, available in vitro data on SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV entry displayed this synergy. Further, analysing the data using our model, we estimated the relative usage of the two pathways and found it to vary widely across cell lines, suggesting that targeting both pathways in vivo may be important and synergistic given the broad tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells and may help improve the deployability of drug combinations targeting host proteases required for the entry.

In the case of short-lived immunity, the level of protection wanes over time and may be boosted upon re-exposure, via infection or vaccination. Previous work developed a simple model capturing waning and boosting immunity, known as the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Waned-Susceptible (SIRWS) model, which exhibits rich dynamical behavior including supercritical and subcritical Hopf bifurcations among other structures. Here, we extend the bifurcation analyses of the SIRWS model to examine the influence of all parameters on these bifurcation structures. We show that the bistable region, involving both a stable fixed point and a stable limit cycle, exists only for a small region of biologically realistic parameter space. Furthermore, we contrast the SIRWS model with a modified version, where immune boosting depends on the occurrence of a secondary infection. Analysis of this extended model shows that oscillations and bistability, as found in the SIRWS model, depend on strong assumptions about infectivity and recovery rate of secondary infection. Understanding the dynamics of models of waning and boosting immunity is important for accurately assessing epidemiological data.

Our model takes into account the action and effect of blood resident human-antibodies, ingested by the mosquito during a blood meal from humans, in inhibiting gamete fertilization. The model also captures subsequent developmental processes that lead to the different forms of the parasite within the mosquito. Continuous functions that model the switching transition from oocyst to sporozoites as well as human antibody density variations within the mosquito gut are proposed and used. In sum, our model integrates the developmental stages of the parasite within the mosquito such as gametogenesis, fertilization and sporogenesis culminating in the formation of sporozoites. Quantitative and qualitative analyses including a sensitivity analysis for influential parameters are performed. We quantify the average sporozoite load produced at the end of the within-mosquito malaria parasite's developmental stages. Our analysis shows that an increase in the efficiency of the ingested human antibodies in inhibiting fertilization within the mosquito's gut results in lowering the density of oocysts and hence sporozoites that are eventually produced by each mosquito vector. So, it is possible to control and limit oocysts development and hence sporozoites development within the mosquito by boosting the efficiency of antibodies as a pathway to the development of transmission-blocking vaccines.

The unique disease-free equilibrium always exists and it is stable if the basic reproduction numbers of heroin use and HIV infection are both less than 1. The semi-trivial equilibrium of HIV infection (heroin use) exists if the basic reproduction number of HIV infection (heroin use) is larger than 1 and it is locally stable if and only if the invasion number of heroin use (HIV infection) is less than 1. When both semi-trivial equilibria lose their stability, a coexistence equilibrium occurs, which may not be unique. We compare the model to US data on heroin use and HIV transmission. We conclude that the two diseases in the US are in a coexistence regime. Elasticities of the invasion numbers suggest two foci for control measures: targeting the drug abuse epidemic and reducing HIV risk in drug-users.

PoMo builds on the standard substitution models of DNA evolution but expands the classic alphabet of the four nucleotide bases to include polymorphic states. By doing so, PoMo accounts for ancestral and current intra-population variation, while also accommodating population-level processes ruling the substitution process (e. g. genetic drift, mutations, allelic selection). PoMo has shown to be a valuable tool in several phylogenetic applications but a proof of statistical consistency (and identifiability, a necessary condition for consistency) is lacking. Here, we prove that PoMo is identifiable and, using this result, we further show that the maximum a posteriori (MAP) tree estimator of PoMo is a consistent estimator of the species tree. We complement our theoretical results with a simulated data set mimicking the diversity observed in natural populations exhibiting incomplete lineage sorting. We implemented PoMo in a Bayesian framework and show that the MAP tree easily recovers the true tree for typical numbers of sites that are sampled in genome-wide analyses.

Collective cell migration is based on the biochemical and mechanical interactions between cells with individual cells regulating their mechanical state and exerting forces on the surrounding tissue. To gain further insights into the multi-scale effects of force propagation from cells to tissues and the shaping properties on whole organisms, it is of great interest to study spatial and temporal dynamics of forces. Force inference is a computational approach to estimate tissue stress from images using a biomechanical model and a mathematical inverse method. It is a good supplement to experimental force measurement techniques like laser ablation. As a non-invasive observation technique, it requires no mechanical probing of the tissue and yields results for the whole system at once. The force inference method proposed by Ishihara and Sugimura (2012) applies a Bayesian framework to handle the indefiniteness of a system of linear force-balance equations. In this study, we use cell-vertex simulation generated data to validate our implementation of Bayesian force inference and apply it to investigate force dynamics in a classical wound healing assay. We discuss our workflow including image segmentation, graph construction and calibration based on force geometry relation, as well as robustness for segmentation errors and theoretical limits of force inference. We find that the method is challenged by ragged boundaries produced with a scratching technique. We show that pressure gradients flatten with closing of the wound.

A recent approach to Bayesian uncertainty quantification using transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) is extremely parallelizable and has opened the door to a variety of applications which were previously too computationally intensive to be practical. In this talk, we first explore the machinery required to understand and implement Bayesian uncertainty quantification using TMCMC. We then describe dissipative particle dynamics, a computational particle simulation method which is suitable for modeling biological structures on the subcellular level, and develop an example simulation of a lipid membrane in fluid. Finally, we apply the algorithm to a basic model of uncertainty in our lipid simulation, effectively recovering a target set of parameters (along with distributions corresponding to the uncertainty) and demonstrating the practicality of Bayesian uncertainty quantification for complex particle simulations.

About 90% of cancer deaths do not occur due to primary tumors but to metastases, of which most are not clinically identifiable due to their relatively small size at primary diagnosis and limited technical possibilities. However, as therapeutic decisions are formed depending on the existence of metastases and their properties - non-identified metastases might have huge influence in the treatment outcome. It is therefore of clinical interest to give an estimation of the metastatic burden to assist in planning optimal treatments accordingly for individual cancer patients. A mathematical model addressing this problem has been developed based on a transport equation introduced by (Iwata et. al. ) and extended by currently available systemic treatment options such as chemo- and immunotherapy. The model is defined in a continuous setting which allows it to also model the transition of a single primary tumor towards a metastatic disease, therefore indicating the metastatic cascade necessary to develop multiple metastatic tumors. Numerical implementation of the model framework allows for parameter estimation from clinical data, in our case we gathered parameter values from systemically treated lung cancer patients. We successfully quantified the total metastatic burden retrospectively for those patients over time given systemic treatment. In silico experiments allow for insights in differing therapeutic schedules, different medications and the further development of the metastatic burden. A sensitivity analysis on the model framework gave valuable insights in the behavior of model parameters and the clinical outcome.

Motivated by promising results from theoretical, experimental and, most recently, clinical studies, there is an in- creasing interest in extending this approach to other cancers. As such, it is urgent to understand the characteristics of a cancer which determine whether it will respond well to adaptive therapy, or not. One plausible such candidate is the “cost of resistance” in which acquisition of the resistance mechanism decreases a cell’s fitness in the absence of drug. To investigate the role of fitness costs, we initially study a simple 2-population ODE model in which we assume tumour cells are either drug-sensitive or resistant and compete in a Lotka-Volterra fashion. We identify the initial fraction of resistance, the proximity of the tumour to carrying capacity, resistance costs and turnover as important determinants of the benefit of adaptive therapy over standard-of-care continuous therapy. Moreover, we show that a resistance cost is neither a necessary nor a sufficient criterion for the success of adaptive therapy, but that the effect of a cost is dependent on the tumour’s proximity to carrying capacity and the rate of cellular turnover. Subsequently, we test whether our conclusions extend into space by considering a 2-D on-lattice cellular automaton model. While all the aforementioned factors remain important, we show that they interact in a non-linear fashion with the spatial architecture of the tumour. To conclude, we will show applications of our insights to the development of an adaptive therapy trial for the treatment of ovarian cancer with PARP inhibitors. This illustrates some of our theoretical predictions and raises new questions about when to adapt therapy and when not to. Overall, our work helps to clarify under which circumstances adaptive therapy may be beneficial and suggests that turnover may play an unexpectedly important role.

Prospective studies with tens of thousands of healthy participants are ongoing to determine whether asymptomatic cancers can be accurately detected by analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from blood samples. We developed a stochastic mathematical model of tumor evolution and ctDNA shedding to investigate the potential and the limitations of ctDNA-based cancer early detection tests.  We inferred ctDNA shedding rates of early stage lung cancers and calculated that a 15 mL blood sample contains on average only 1. 5 genome equivalents of ctDNA for lung tumors with 1 billion cells (size of  1 cm3).  We considered two clinically different scenarios: cancer screening and cancer relapse detection.  For monthly relapse testing with a sequencing panel covering 20tumor-specific mutations, we found a median detection size of 0. 24 cm3 corresponding to a lead time of 160 days compared to imaging-based relapse detection.  For annual screening, we found a median detection size of 2. 8-4. 8 cm3 depending on the sequencing panel size and on the mutation frequency.  The expected detection sizes correspond to lead times of 390-520 days compared to current median lung tumor sizes at diagnosis.  This quantitative framework provides a mechanistic interpretation of ctDNA-based cancer detection approaches and helps to optimize cancer early detection strategies.

PBPK can be used to compute and test optimal dosing strategies, among other features, of proposed treatments using known or learned kinetics of the system mimicking complex human physiology.  In turn, PBPK modeling can enable more efficient design and optimization of in vivo experiments, and consequently accelerate pre-clinical screening and development.  I will discuss the application of PBPK modeling to an important problem in the medical community – the accelerated clearance of PEGylated drugs in the presence of anti-PEG antibodies (APA).  While this phenomenon renders an entire class of drugs (i. e. , PEGylated drugs) ineffective in many patients, the medical community is largely unaware of how drastically this can alter prognosis or how to mitigate this effect.  I will describe a multi-compartment PBPK model to accurately capture and ultimately predict clearance behavior, with the goal of validating results against drug biodistribution data obtained via PET/CT technology.  Specifically, I will focus on the initial transient dynamics as nanomedicines are cleared from the circulation in patients with high APA titers.  I will then discuss further applications for this model in the context of targeted therapeutics.

We do know that microorganisms colonizing human bodies exceed the total number of human cells, and that the number of microbial genes inside our bodies is roughly 100 times higher than the number of genes contained in the human genome, impacting human biology in various ways. For instance, the human immune system is in great part composed of and trained by resident microorganisms, and different microbiome compositions associate with the onset and progression of a large variety of human diseases, including diseases typically considered as non-communicable. Functional, causal links remain largely unexplored in many cases, however, in great part due to sampling limitations, data volume and integration complexity. Due to this gap and the importance of studying microbiome interactions, we have developed methods and tools toward multi-scale analysis and predictive (mechanistic) modeling, as well as integration of multi ‘omics’ data. On the one hand, feature selection and machine learning allows identification of patterns and relationships in large data collections, such as those in human microbiota studies. On the other, mathematical modeling and simulations provide a comprehensive framework to identify connections and key (onset) mechanisms in disease models. Both approaches are essential for analysis and forward engineering personalized therapeutics. In this talk, I will discuss available tools and mathematical methods in this area of research, and what is still needed toward integrative models of host-microbiota dynamics.

Skin pattern formation is an early process during the embryogenesis and happens before the cells fully differentiate. In the present project we consider skin patterning in mouse embryos, where cell aggregates form based on a hierarchical process, involving interactions between the epidermal cell populations. The reaction-diffusion pre-pattern is driven by fibroblast growth factor (FGF20), bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and WNT. Considering mathematical models, there are two main processes involved in the pattern formation: Turing reaction-diffusion systems and chemotaxis. The Turing system models the concentration of two interacting chemicals, and the patterns arises from an instability driven by a difference between their diffusion coefficients. Some previous studies show that this behavior is essential for self-organization in the mouse hair follicle and chicken feather pre-pattern formation. Another key mechanism is chemotaxis, where the cells move in the direction of a chemical attractant, where patterns can also be observed. Experimental data indicates a hierarchical system, where cell chemotaxis is guided by a Turing system. We aim at developing mathematical models to describe the underlying biological processes leading to skin patterning, especially the interaction of chemotaxis with reaction-diffusion (Turing) systems. A mathematical model using partial differential equations is solved numerically, and some results are presented and compared to the experimental data. We study the parameter-dependence of the model and different model structures, and their impact on the pattern forming process. According to the experimental data the Turing system and the chemotaxis seems to be intrinsically related on the mouse skin patterning.

Strangely, their theorem was largely accepted for more than half a century, until Haldane and Steffensen established the true dichotomy between subcritical populations always dying out and supercritical, which either die out or else grow exponentially. But this is under stable conditions. For population-size-dependent reproduction, we show the following very general extinction theorem: Consider a process giving the size of a population in discrete time. Asume that reproductive events occur one-by-one so that at each step the population either decreases by one (an individual dies) or increases by a random number (the number of children born at the event). Note that theses changes are neither assumed independent nor identically distributed. On the contrary, there is a carrying capacity K, such that the process constitutes a supermartingale when larger than K and a submartingale otherwise.

In this formalism, the central component is the fitness potential, from which we obtain an expression for the amount of work necessary for a given type to reach fixation. In particular, within this interpretation, we develop a graphical analysis — similar to the one used in classical mechanics — providing the basic tool for a simple heuristic that describes both the short and long term dynamics. Using this toolkit, we propose a definition of an evolutionary stable state in finite population that includes the case of mixed populations. We also discuss extensions to more than two types and weak mutation. This is joint work with Fabio A. C. C.

This is the idea that particular ecologies and environments can scaffold Darwinian properties onto groups of cells.  The scaffolding allows cells to directly participate in the process of evolution by natural selection as if they were members of multicellular collectives, with groups participating in a birth-death process.  The ingredients for this process to operate are only patchily distributed resources and a regularly occurring dispersal process that also creates a bottleneck.  In this talk, I will discuss the effect of bottleneck size on this process and how this alters the evolutionary dynamics at both levels of the system.

In a tumor, neighboring subclonal cancer cell populations interact both through competition for resources and through cooperation, by the production of growth promoting signals. Promoting competition can maintain drug sensitivity when resistant cells get outcompeted. Cooperation can promote cell survival under selective pressure, as well as potentially protect cellular populations that may otherwise be susceptible to treatment. Our research program integrates three key components to quantify cancer cell interactions: serial patient tumor samples molecularly profiled at the single cell level, a parallel in vitro model system where mechanisms can be tested through experimental manipulation and measured over time, and integrative dynamic mathematical models of the growth and interaction of subclonal cancer populations. By embedding the time course data and differential equation models into a Bayesian inference framework, we can estimate the strength of positive and negative interactions between subclonal populations during treatment and identify key mechanisms driving cell communication. Our analyses of patient derived samples further indicates that heterogeneous multi-clonal ER+ breast cell populations evolve to acquire alternative signaling states that drive cell cycle progression independent of estrogen availability, and that cells can cooperate to survive during therapy through the increased production and local sharing of growth promoting factors.

Many are confused, rely on less than reliable sources for information, and reject scientific authorities equating the evolution of knowledge to lack of expertise. Given the current situation: what is our role and responsibility as educators to help our students be more informed, critical thinkers? How must we empower them through education to identify reliable sources and to better understand the scientific process? In this talk, we will reflect on ways in which we can respond to the current knowledge deficit, and why it is our duty to do so.

The turgor-driven diffuse growth of a cell can be highly anisotropic: significant in the longitudinal direction and negligible in the radial direction. Such anisotropy is ensured by cellulose microfibrils (CMF) reinforcing the cell wall in the hoop direction. To maintain the cell's integrity during growth, new wall material including CMF must be continually deposited. In this talk, I will present a mathematical model which describes the cell as a cylindrical pressure vessel and the cell wall as a fibre-reinforced viscous sheet, explicitly including the mechano-sensitive angle of CMF deposition. The model incorporates interactions between turgor, external forces, CMF reorientation during wall extension, and matrix stiffening. I will explain the general formulation of the model from a fluid mechanics perspective, and summarise the technical steps required in order to obtain evolution equations for growth variables such as cell length and twist. I will discuss how the handedness of helical cell growth depends on external torque and intrinsic wall properties, and interpret numerical simulation results in light of recent experimental findings. Overall, the model provides a meaningful step towards a unified mechanical framework for understanding left- and right-handed growth as seen in many plants. Such a framework can help us harness the potential of plants in our effort to address society's sustainable development needs.

Pavement cells in the plant leaf epidermis form interesting and intriguing interlocking puzzle like shapes with undulations of lobes and indents. However, no one has been able to fully explain how these shapes form. There are two possible pathways of pavement cell development, one involving a combination of plant Rho like GTPases signalling proteins and cytoskeleton components, specifically microtubules which could provide a feedback loop and the second being possible mechanical effects from the tissue. As a result, we have developed three models, one to model microtubule behaviour, the second to model the protein signalling dynamics and the third to model the mechanics of the cells, using a stochastic network, reaction diffusion equations solved via the finite element method and a visco-elastic vertex element model. I shall also outline some of the experimental procedures we have carried out to test how pavement cells develop. We can demonstrate that the signalling pathways provide a feedback loop to sustain pavement cell shape, but don’t initiate the shape, while the mechanical effects from the tissue can initiate pavement cell lobes.

For such leaves, a unidirectional growth occurring for a long time enables us to observe a series of successive morphogenetic stages at one snapshot. In this work, we propose the concept of using a growing wheat leaf to study dynamical changes in morphogenesis, including stress-induced changes. Linear leaf of wheat, during its formation for a long time, maintains a phase of steady growth. Therefore, it is possible to observe a series of successive events of morphogenesis fixed in the cellular architecture of a mature leaf. High-resolution 3D LSM-images allow extracting quantitative characteristics describing the cellular structure of leaf epidermis. However, to obtain a large number of statistical data methods of high throughput, computer-based image segmentation should be used. We developed a workflow for the detection of structural properties of leaf epidermis from 3D images obtained from confocal LSM-images (Zubairova, U. S. , Verman, P. Y. , Oshchepkova, P. A. , Elsukova, A. S. , &amp; Doroshkov, A. V. (2019). LSM-W 2: laser scanning microscopy worker for wheat leaf surface morphology. BMC systems biology, 13(1), 22. ). The workflow includes the protocol of sample preparation, image processing ImageJ-plugin, and data extraction algorithms. The data on the cellular architecture further acts as a basis for the elaboration and verification of spatial models accounting for structural features of leaves. For the leaf epidermis of cereals, a brickwork-like pattern combined with unidirectional growth allows to reduce the dimension and use a quasi-one-dimensional representation of the cellular ensemble in the model. This idea was realized in the model (Zubairova, U. , Nikolaev, S. , Penenko, A. , Podkolodnyy, N. , Golushko, S. , Afonnikov, D. , &amp; Kolchanov, N. (2016). Mechanical behavior of cells within a cell-based model of wheat leaf growth. Frontiers in plant science, 7, 1878. ) growth of a linear leaf blade. The model allows for fitting of the visible cell length using the experimental cell length distribution along the longitudinal axis of leaf epidermis. In this work, we assume a unidirectional growing cell ensemble starting from a meristem-like layer of generative cells and then generating parallel cell rows from every cell of the initial layer. We considered the growth zone of the leaf includes division and elongation zones; also, the division zone consists of a region of asymmetric divisions forming specialized cells (trichomes and stomata). The model was verified on qualitative and quantitative data on stress-induced disturbances of morphogenesis in the epidermis of a wheat leaf. The study was carried out with a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (project No. 19-74-10037).

The nucleus tracks the growing tip remaining ≈ 75 μm back from the growing front [1]. While the nucleus motion has been studied, less work has considered the nucleus shape during growth and how this impacts cell growth. Using a numerical model, we analyse the forces imposed on the nucleus by the cytoskeleton (the internal fibre network of the cell), for a range of nucleus shape, size and position enclosed within a cuboidal domain. We compare our results with experimental data from root hairs grown within microchannels. We segment the experimental images to reconstruct the 3D nuclei shapes, from which we can also estimate the spacial distribution of forces being imposed.

Auxin spatial patterning is critical in the phyllotactic arrangement of leaves along a stem, the shapes of the leaves themselves, and venation within leaves. These patterns depend on polar auxin transport (PAT) at the cellular level, particularly the preferential allocation of PIN efflux proteins to certain areas of the plasma membrane. Two general mechanisms have been studied: an up-the-gradient (UTG) allocation dependent on neighbouring-cell auxin concentrations, and a with-the-flux (WTF) allocation dependent on the flow of auxin across walls. Auxin appears to flow both towards auxin maxima (associated with UTG) and away from auxin maxima (associated with WTF), depending on the developmental phenomena. Both types of flow are implicated in vein patterning in leaves. We have developed a UTG+WTF model to quantify these combined dynamics. The model simulates intracellular and membrane kinetics and intercellular transport, and is solved for a 2D leaf of several hundred cells. Building upon earlier models for primary vein (mid-vein) formation, we developed a model for the formation of the secondary vein pattern. These arise from the margin of the leaf, in a distal to proximal sequence, and connect with the mid-vein to form the main vascular network of the leaf. These networks can be characteristic of species, and associated with species-specific leaf morphologies. The model responds to decreasing PAT, as in experiments increasing the PAT inhibitor NPA, with: a switch from several distinct vein initiation sites to many less-distinct sites; a delay in vein canalization; inhibited connection of new veins to old; and finally loss of patterning in the margin, loss of vein extension, and confinement of auxin to the margin. We have removed assumptions of long range attraction factors from earlier work. Simulations of vein patterning and leaf growth indicate that growth itself may help bridge the scale from the cell-cell resolution of the PIN-auxin dynamics to vein patterns on the whole-leaf scale.

This opportunity is accompanied by a challenge: how do mathematics educators, some of whom have little personal experience with mathematical modeling, teach mathematical epidemiology to their students in courses ranging from precalculus to differential equations, and do so in a way that builds understanding of epidemic disease dynamics as well as mathematical methods? We address this issue by presenting a framework based on a multiple representation theory of mathematical modeling and using that framework to offer examples of building blocks that include a physical simulation activity, model development, parameterization, various methods for analysis and visualization of results, and guidelines for how to get students to use writing to facilitate their understanding.

College undergraduate education traditionally occurs in disciplinary silos, which creates a steep learning curve at the graduate and postdoctoral levels that increasingly bridge multiple disciplines. Numerous colleges have begun to embrace interdisciplinary curricula, but students who double-major in mathematics (or other quantitative sciences) and biology (or medicine) remain scarce. We identified the need to educate junior and senior high school students about integrating mathematical and biological skills, through the lens of mathematical oncology, to better prepare students for future careers at the interdisciplinary interface. The High school Internship Program in Integrated Mathematical Oncology (HIP IMO) at Moffitt Cancer Center has so far trained 59 students between 2015 and 2019. We report here on the program structure, training deliverables, curriculum, and outcomes. We hope to promote interdisciplinary educational activities early in a student's career.

In mice, longitudinal measurements are possible by using reporter sendai viruses that express luciferase, where the insertion location yields wild-type (rSeV-luc(M-F)) or attenuated (rSeV-luc(P-M)) phenotypes. Bioluminescence from individual animals suggests that there is a rapid increase in expression within the first 1-2 days followed by a peak, biphasic clearance, and resolution. However, these kinetics vary with dose, strain, individuals, and the upper and lower respiratory tracts. To quantify the differences, we first translated the bioluminescence measurements taken from nasopharynx, trachea, and lungs into viral loads. We then fit a mathematical model to the estimated viral load data for each scenario using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. The results confirmed a higher rate of virus production with the rSeV-luc(M-F) virus compared to its attenuated counterpart, and suggested that the infected cell clearance was expedited when infected with rSeV-luc(M-F) in lungs with high dose. Our analysis suggested that the number of infected cells scales with dose, and that distinct infected cell clearance rates are associated with each dose, strain, individual and respiratory tract compartment. This analysis provides important insight into parainfluenza infection kinetics and the dynamical differences based on dose, viral attenuation, individual heterogeneity, and tissue tropism.

We have recently developed a stochastic hybrid model of the GC reaction that combines: i) an intra-cellular gene circuit that captures the regulatory interplay of a few key master regulators of the differentiation process; and ii) an extra-cellular component that accounts for the stochastic events that take place in the GC, such as antigen acquisition and competition for T cell help (https://www. mdpi. com/2073-4409/9/6/1448). Mimicking the evolutionary processes undergone by B cells, in our model new B cells constantly emerge exhibiting mutated BCRs that present different affinity to the existing pool of antigens, which in turn probabilistically bias their evolution to certain fates. We faithfully recapitulate the process of BCR maturation by explicitly modelling the hypermutation process that takes place in the BCR genes. We compare the model predictions to experimental data of matched single-cell transcriptional high-resolution maps and BCR repertoire sequencing of GC B cells.  Our explicit modeling of B cell maturation enables us to characterise the evolutionary processes and competition at the heart of the GC dynamics, and explains the emergence of clonal dominance as a result of initially small stochastic advantages in the affinity to antigen. Interestingly, a subset of the GC undergoes massive expansion of higher-affinity B cell variants (clonal bursts), leading to a loss of clonal diversity at a significantly faster rate than in GCs that do not exhibit clonal dominance. Our work contributes towards an in silico vaccine design, and has implications for the better understanding of the mechanisms underlying autoimmune disease and GC-derived lymphomas.

Here, using data of mice infected with influenza, we develop a stochastic mathematical modeling scheme to explore the impact of consecutive influenza A infection in the cross-reactome. The model successfully recapitulates the antibody cross-reactive data from mice infected with different H3N2 influenza strains. Of note, without framework modifications, the model can also represent the Abs response in mice to diverse H1N1 strains. Furthermore, we found that while the antigen differences, time of infection, and the B-cells population shape between infections directly influence the Abs outcome, the naive B-cells repertoire has minor effects on Abs behavior. Importantly, we found that affinity changes in immunity between infections satisfy necessary conditions for a successful Abs cross-reaction. We envisage this work will add to the forces among public makers, virologists, biologists, and theoreticians, bringing clarity of mind when experimental and clinical evidence is fragmented.

Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-, cellular-, and multicellular-scale processes that drive disease dynamics is limited. Multiscale simulation models can shed light on these dynamics, identify actionable 'choke points' for intervention, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate patient outcomes. In this talk, we present progress by a multi-institution, multi-disciplinary coalition of over 40 mathematical biologists, immunologists, virologists, pharmacologists, and others to build a comprehensive multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and immune response in lung tissue. We will demonstrate and explore the current spatio-temporal agent-based model prototype, which includes intracellular virus and chemokine transport, virus-ACE2 receptor binding, receptor trafficking, viral replication dynamics (and subsequent viral release), infected cell phenotypic responses, cell-cell communication, immune cell recruitment, chemotactic exploration, T cell attacks on infected cells, and phagocytosis. This coalition-based approach is developing submodels in parallel and coordination, allowing us to rapidly advance towards a framework that can drive many independent investigations on COVID-19. Moreover, the novel mix of domain experts is fueling creative advances and new technical capabilities in multiscale tissue modeling. We anticipate that this progress will drive advances in immunology, inflammation, CAR T cell therapy, and virus-driven carcinogenesis for years to come.

On March 12, the University of Ottawa commissioned an informal modeling study to aid in their decision-making process. Here we present the results from that study: a differential-equation model was created in order to describe the states of susceptibility, exposure, infection, asymptomatic individuals, recovery and death. Our results shows that, in the worst-case scenario, the epidemic would peak at 7000 cases on campus with 63 dead, starting 115 days after the first case. Reducing contacts by 50% could lower the number of cases and fatalities, but it would expand the timeframe by several years. One day after this modeling study was completed, the University of Ottawa closed campus entirely. It follows that modeling and simulation in the midst of a fast-moving pandemic can be valuable tools for decision-makers.

The number of HIV infections has more than doubled in the Philippines within the last decade, prompting the need to develop a model of disease transmission in the country. In this study, disease-free and endemic equilibria are obtained, stability analysis is performed, and the basic reproduction number is computed. Available data is utilized to identify model parameters giving insights on the trend of the disease in the country. Furthermore, effectiveness of control measures including precaution, HIV screening, Anti-Retroviral Treatment, and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) are investigated in the framework of optimal control theory. These various control efforts are compared with regard to cost efficiency and effectivity in minimizing the number of infected individuals. Given limited available control measures, PrEP-only scenario is shown to be most cost effective.

Effective control measures considering spatial heterogeneity to mitigate the HPAI epidemic is still a challenging issue. Here we develop a farm-based HPAI model to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of the epidemic and assess the impact of control strategies. The epidemiological and geographical data of the domestic poultry farms in South Korea are used to find the best-fitted parameters of the model. We investigate potential for two control measures against HPAI: preemptive culling and farm rest. The best culling radius to maximize the final size of the susceptible farms and minimize the total number of culled farms is calculated from the model. The reproductive number of a farm is calculated as an indicator of virus transmission in a given area. Simulation results indicate that this parameter is strongly influenced not only by epidemiological factors such as transmissibility and/or susceptibility of poultry species but also by geographical and demographical factors such as the distribution of poultry farms (or density) and connectivity (or distance) between farms. Based on this result, we suggest the optimal culling radius and number of resting farms with respect to the reproductive number in a targeted area.

These “dependent happenings” cause fundamental problems for standard principles of epidemiologic study design and data analysis in infectious disease epidemiology. Pairwise survival analysis is an extension of standard survival analysis to the transmission of infectious diseases through households, hospitals, or other situations where there is a clearly-defined population at risk of infection. We show how this framework can be used to assess and control for confounding and selection bias. We then show how these methods can be used to extend traditional derivations of case-control and case-cohort designs to obtain novel study designs for outbreak investigations and public health intervention trials for emerging infections. Finally, we consider the possibilities for incorporating pathogen genetic sequences.

Countries around the world have implemented population-wide interventions in efforts to control COVID-19, with varying extent and success. Many jurisdictions are moving to relax measures, while others are re-intensifying them to curb growing spread. But uncertainty remains around the length of time between a population-level change in control measures and its observable impact on detected cases. I will describe our recent work in estimating the time frame for a substantial difference between the cases that occur following a change in control and those that would have occurred under continued strategy, under a compartmental model for disease transmission incorporating physical distancing. Using a likelihood-based approach and data from British Columbia, Canada, we examine how long it takes to detect such a difference given delays and noise in reported cases. We find that these time frames are long: longer than the mean incubation period and the often-used 14 days.

However, most clinical evaluations of vaccines and other interventions designed to prevent infection do not use these models. Instead, clinical infectious disease epidemiologists use randomized trials and statistical regression models to evaluate interventions. Recent work has shown that these approaches may deliver erroneous estimates of the susceptibility effect of the vaccine, even when treatment is randomized or all baseline confounders are measured. In this presentation, we develop approaches to causal evaluation of interventions in networked populations in randomized and observational trials using a flexible semi-parametric class of stochastic transmission models. We show analytically and by simulation that causal susceptibility and infectiousness effects are identified, and that researchers do not need to specify the functional form of some model components in order to make useful inferences. The approach illustrated in an application to evaluation of risk factors for tuberculosis in a large-scale cluster cohort study.

SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model is the classical method for modeling infectious disease spread. In this research, we applied solutions of ordinary differential equations describing the large-population limits of Markovian stochastic epidemic models to individual-level SIR model by introducing survival or cumulative hazard functions derived from population-level equations. We call the method as survival dynamical system (SDS). In this research, we also construct an additional estimation step for initial number of susceptible by utilizing a hierarchical Bayesian approach for inference of the number of trials in the Binomial distribution. we applied the SDS approach to data from a 2009 influenza A(H1N1) outbreak at Washington State University.

Although there has been ample theoretical and experimental studies of the olfactory bulb (OB), dissecting the circuit mechanisms of modulation of the first and second order (MC) spiking statistics of populations is lacking.  In particular, we analyze data from our (Shew) lab in spontaneous and odor-evoked states n vivo, with multi-electrode arrays that enable studying second order spiking statistics with simultaneous recordings. Based on a multicompartment large-scale biophysical model, we develop a reduced firing rate model that enables us to efficiently and accurately capture our data.  We show that granule cell inhibition in particular helps decorrelate in the spontaneous state but is unlocked so that there is stimulus-induced correlation in the evoked state; this is in contrast to many cortical sensory systems where there is often stimulus-induced decorrelation. We also consider pharmacological drug applications to manipulate inhibitory synaptic strengths (both PGC and GC) that alter the spiking statistics. Our model qualitatively captures the statistically significant changes.

Recently, novel experiments were performed wherein current applied to individual neurons was continuously ramped to mimic biologically realistic neuronal input (at Florida State University, the Trombley lab performed) in comparison to previous standard protocols where current is applied in steps. However, this new stimulus protocol raises the questions of what is the proper way to interpret these data and how can mathematical analysis help? In this project, we have developed an integrated experimental-mathematical methodology to study transient dynamics in the electrical activity of single neurons while maintaining a close interdisciplinary collaboration with the biologists who carry out these electrophysiological experiments. One of the aims of our work is to create a positive feedback loop wherein experimental data informs the mathematical model, and in turn, the model directs future experiments. In particular, we are using bifurcation analysis to characterize the onset and offset of tonic spiking as well as the frequency of spiking in a neuron stimulated with both slow and fast applied current ramps. This work allows us to understand how different ion channels shape the transient response dynamics in OBDA neurons. Importantly, we have also developed mathematical tools that can be used to explore the behavior of other cell types as it is our belief that the ramping technique could be extended to study the single-neuron dynamics of all neuron types. The use of fast-slow analysis helps us to understand how the ramped applied current and the slow M-type Potassium channel influence tonic spiking behavior and frequency. Ultimately, this work helps close the gap between mathematical modeling and biological data in computational neuroscience.

This organization emerges during early postnatal development through patterned spontaneous activity and manifests both locally where nearby synapses tend to share functional properties, and globally with distance to the soma. Recent experimental studies reveal species-specific differences in this organization between mouse, ferret and macaque visual cortex: While in the mouse, synapses are retinotopically organized along the proximal-distal axis of the dendrite, no such organization is present in the ferret or macaque. Instead, here synapses are organized into local clusters according to orientation preference. We propose a computational framework that combines activity derived from retinal waves with functional and structural plasticity to generate these different types of organization across species, as well as across scales by including attenuating backpropagating action potentials. Within this framework, a single anatomical factor -- the size of the visual cortex and the resulting magnification of visual space -- can explain the observed differences. This allows us to make predictions about the organization of synapses also in other species and indicates that the proximal-distal axis of a dendrite might be central in endowing a neuron with its powerful computational capacities.

Carving out functionally determined, cell-type specific circuit wiring is an essential component of this hypothesis. However, the plasticity rules for different interneuron subtypes, and how their interactions shape network dynamics are largely unexplored. We use in vitro patch clamp techniques paired with cell-specific optogenetic stimulation to measure the spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rules of the inhibitory inputs onto excitatory (E) pyramidal neurons from both Parvalbumin (PV) and Somatostatin (SOM) interneurons in mouse orbital frontal cortex (OFC). Consistent with past studies, PV inhibition shows a symmetric STDP that is often associated with the homeostatic control of excitatory firing rates. By contrast, SOM inhibition shows an asymmetric Hebbian STDP rule, so that recurrent SOM inhibition onto driving E neurons will ultimately depress. To understand the role of these different plasticity mechanisms in network dynamics we exploit large-scale network simulations of networks of spiking neuron model with plastic synapses, along with associated mean field theories of synaptic dynamics. We show that the asymmetric SOM plasticity rule promotes cross-inhibition between distinct E neuron assemblies, effectively providing a mechanism for competition between functionally grouped principle neurons. This competition will enhance computations where input comparisons must be made, as is often the case in decision task where the OFC is known to be essential. However, strong cross inhibition could lead to extreme (and unstable) winner-take-all assembly dynamics. Fortunately, the symmetric PV plasticity rule provides stability for the circuit, ensuring rich network dynamics. Finally, the increased correlations due to the asymmetric Hebbian learning for SOM connections to pyramidal cells can speed up assembly formation during training and slow assembly degradation post training.

Many cells are known to degrade the molecules that attract them, creating dynamic gradients that evolve and change as the cells migrate up them. In unrestricted environments, this enables more robust directed migration over much greater distances than can be explained by chemotaxis to an externally imposed gradient. However, its effects in a complex topology remain unclear. This is important to understand, because the in-vivo topologies in which cells migrate are almost invariably complex. We therefore modelled the behaviour of cells solving a variety of mazes, varying dead end lengths and complexities. We then tested each design experimentally. We found specific rules governing the collective decisions of cells connecting cell speed, attractant diffusivity and dead-end length and complexity. We even found topologies in which a majority of cells would favour a dead end over a path to a large attractant reservoir. This self-generated view of chemotaxis in complex environments will help us better understand immune responses and the patterns of metastasis for some cancers.

Since cancer cells can arise from any type of cell in the body, cancers can grow in or around any tissue or organ making the disease highly complex. Our research is focused on understanding the specific mechanisms that occur in the tumour microenvironment via mathematical and computational modeling. We present a 3D individual-based model which allows one to simulate the behaviour of, and spatio-temporal interactions between, cells, extracellular matrix fibres and blood vessels. Each agent (a single cell, for example) is fully realised within the model and interactions are primarily governed by mechanical forces between elements. However, as well as the mechanical interactions we also consider chemical interactions, for example, by coupling the code to a finite element solver to model the diffusion of oxygen from blood vessels to cells. The current state of the art of the model allows us to simulate tumour growth around an arbitrary blood-vessel network or along the striations of fibrous tissue.

There is no general approach which allow us to obtain mathematical results for such phenomena. However, assuming that Ω(t) is a circle and it is changing uniformly in all directions we are able to prove existence and uniqueness of solution.

Before we are born we get oxygen from our mother’s blood through the pla- centa, and after birth the lungs take over the placenta’s role exchanging oxygen from the air. These two exchange organs have complex vascular branching structures with multiple generations of asymmetrically branching blood vessels which provide a large capillary surface area for exchange. Disruptions to this vascular branching and heterogeneity in blood delivery (perfusion) have been implicated in a number of diseases. Often, micro-vascular dysfunction contributes to an organ scale pathology, which can be difficult to detect in clinical imaging. We present organ-scale computational models vascular networks in lung and placenta, which take as inputs vascular anatomy derived from imaging, and simulate both haemodynamic and exchange function. This allows functional prediction of how anatomical perturbations in vascular structures contribute to organ function in health and disease, and provides steps toward determining what constitutes normal and abnormal levels of vascular heterogeneity in representative populations.

How- ever, despite recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) imaging, there has been poor understanding of geometric and physical factors that determine solute exchange and link the structure and function. Here, we use an example of the human placenta, a fetal life-support system, where the primary exchange units, terminal villi, contain disordered networks of fetal capillaries and are surrounded externally by maternal blood. We show how the irregular internal structure of a terminal villus determines its exchange capacity for a wide range of solutes, integrating 3D image-based properties into new non-dimensional parameters. We characterise the structure-function relationship of terminal villi via a simple and robust algebraic approximation, revealing transitions between flow- and diffusion-limited transport at vessel and network levels. The developed theory accommodates for nonlinear blood rheology and tissue metabolism and offers an efficient method for multi-scale modelling [2]. Our results show how physical estimates of trans- port, based on scaling arguments and carefully defined geometric statistics, provide a useful tool for understanding solute exchange in placental and other complex microvascular systems.

In the brain, neural activity induces changes in blood flow by locally dilating vessels in the brain microvasculature. How can the local dilation of a single vessel increase flow-based metabolite supply, given that flows are globally coupled within the microvasculature? Here, we build a theoretical model for flow-based transport and absorption of nutrients and determine how capillary geometry and network topology affect the control by active adaptation. On the level of an individual capillary, we derive ana- lytically how vessel parameters affect the change in supply due to dilation. Solving the supply dynamics for a rat brain microvasculature, we find one parameter regime to dominate physiologically. This regime allows for robust increase in supply independent of the position in the network, which we explain ana- lytically. We show that local coupling of vessels promotes spatially correlated increased supply by dilation.

Mathematical modelling offers insight into the dynamics of the system and allows efficient examination of physiological and therapeutic parameters. We adapt existing continuum models for the delivery of magnetic nanoparticles [2] to magnetic cell delivery. Cells are captured on the vessel wall closest to the magnet, this leads to the growth of a solid cell aggregate which obstructs the flow. We determine how the interplay between aggregate growth af- fects stem cell capture and identify parameter regimes in which potentially dangerous vessel blockage is predicted.

Mathematically, it is common to represent such systems as networks, where nodes are individuals and edges denote connections. Adaptive network models explore the dynamic relationship between node properties and network topology. For opinion dynamics, adaptive voter models provide two mechanisms through which changes can occur within the network. First, through homophily, an edge forms between two individuals who already agree; second, through social learning, an individual adopts one of their neighbor’s opinions. Central to these models is assortative mixing: individuals more frequently attach to those who are similar to them, which facilitates the formation of sub-communities of like-minded individuals. However, it is not always the case that individuals want to cluster into homogeneous groups. Instead, they might attempt to surround themselves with individuals who both agree and disagree with them, in an effort to attain a balance of inclusion and distinctiveness in their social environments. In this work, we explore the effects that such preferences for heterogeneous environments have on the dynamics of the adaptive voter model.

Many species are unicellular but some form simple colonies. Some of the colonies reproduce by splitting into equal parts others produce unicellular propagules.

We developed the stage-structured matrix population model of the growth and reproduction of unstructured multicellular organisms. Using this model, we investigated the conditions favoring the evolution of diverse life cycles: unicellular, with an equal split of a colony, and with the reproduction via single-cell bottleneck. We identified the set of profiles of size-dependent growth and death rates promoting each of these life cycles. We found that the conditions promoting a single-cell bottleneck are the steady improvement in the performance of the colony with its size. At the same time, the equal splits require the sudden rise in growth rate (drop in the death rate) at the size of the newborn offspring. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the patterns behind the evolution of multicellular life cycles.

Here, we model collective behavior in complex environments with many potentially distracting cues. Counter-intuitively, large-scale coordination in such environments can be maximized by strongly limiting the cognitive capacity of individuals, where due to self-organized dynamics the collective self-isolates from disrupting information. We observe a fundamental trade-off between coordination and collective responsiveness to environmental cues. Our results offer important insights into possible evo- lutionary trade-offs in collective behavior in biology and suggests novel principles for design of artificial swarms exploiting attentional bottlenecks. 									  											  									  									  								  								  								  								  								  								  						  										 						 																		 		  			             		    		  									                15 minute break (11:00-11:15am)                								  		    		      		        Sub-group minisymposia (11:15am)		        			  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  				  																																		 	CDEV: Understanding development through theory and experiment (11:15am-12:45pm)													 						  			  				  							  							  										  									  	Shane Hutson								  	 								  		Vanderbilt University								  									  									  										  			&lt;/br&gt; Something's wrong in the (cellular) neighborhood: Mechanisms of wound detection in epithelia 								  										  									  									  										  										  											  			When a sheet of epithelial cells is wounded, cells around the wound are recruited from their near quiescent state to reactivate motility and proliferation behaviors similar to early development. As the first stage of that recruitment, surrounding epithelial cells undergo a dramatic increase in cytosolic calcium. This increase occurs quickly: calcium floods into damaged cells within 0. 1 s, moves into adjacent cells over ~20 s, and appears in a much larger set of surrounding cells via a delayed second expansion over 40-300 s. Nonetheless, increased calcium is a reporter; cells must detect wounds even earlier. Using the calcium response as a proxy for wound detection, we identify an upstream G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway, including the receptor and its chemokine ligand. We present experimental and computational evidence that the pathway involves the chemokine acting as a protease bait. Its pro-peptide form is already present extracellularly and is converted to an active form by multiple proteases released during cell lysis/wounding. We will discuss the experimental evidence and corresponding computational models developed to test the plausibility of these hypothesized mechanisms.

' – Viktor Hamburger Evolution has generated an enormous diversity of biological form. Given this diversity, it is highly likely that every tissue structure that one can imagine has been built by the embryo of one species or another. We are interested in uncovering the physical (mechanical) mechanisms by which epithelial sheets fold themselves into branching tubes in the embryo, and using those mechanisms to engineer tissues in culture. Over the past half century, developmental biologists have identified several biochemical signaling pathways and genetic control mechanisms necessary for tissue morphogenesis. In parallel, biological systems must obey Newton’s laws of motion, and physical forces need to be generated in order to sculpt simple populations of cells into complex tissue forms. Inspired by the evolutionary diversity of embryonic forms, we have created microfabrication- and lithographic tissue engineering-based approaches to investigate the mechanical forces and downstream signaling pathways that are responsible for generating the airways of the lung. I will discuss how we combine these experimental techniques with computational models to uncover the physical forces that drive morphogenesis. I will also describe efforts to uncover and actuate the different physical mechanisms used to build the airways in lungs from birds, mammals, and reptiles.

Apart from chemical signals exchanged between cells, a prominent role is played by the extracellular matrix (ECM); these are the hard or jelly materials (e. g. collagens, fibronectin) that form the micro-environment of many cells in tissues. To get a better grip on the role of the extracellular matrix in determining the behavior of cells, we are developing mathematical and computational approaches to analyse the interactions of the mechanics of cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). The cell models are usually based on the Cellular Potts model, whereas the ECM is model is based on a variety of approaches, including the finite-element model and molecular dynamics. I will discuss how these mathematical approaches help to elucidate the regulation of cell migration, collective cell behavior during angiogenesis and other mechanisms, including epithelial branching and the evolution of multicellularity.

IMMU: Increasingly biologically accurate models of influenza A virus infection spread in vivo &amp; in vitro (11:15am-12:45pm)													 						  			  				  							  							  										  									  	Christian Quirouette								  	 								  		Ryerson University								  									  									  										  			&lt;/br&gt; A mathematical model describing the localization and spread of influenza A virus infection within the human respiratory tract 								  										  									  									  										  										  											  			Within the human respiratory tract (HRT), virus diffuses through the periciliary fluid (PCF) bathing the epithelium. But it also undergoes advection: as the mucus layer sitting atop the PCF is pushed along by the ciliated cell’s beating cilia, the PCF and its virus contents are also pushed along, upwards towards the nose and mouth. Many mathematical models (MMs) describe the course of influenza virus infections in vivo, but none consider the impact of both diffusion and advection on the infection’s kinetics and localization. Our MM represents the HRT as a one-dimensional track extending from the nose down to the lower HRT, wherein stationary cells interact with virus which moves within (diffusion) and along with (advection) the PCF. Diffusion was found to be negligible in the presence of advection which effectively sweeps away virus, preventing infection from disseminating below the depth of deposition. Higher virus production rates (10-fold) are required at higher advection speeds (40 micron/s) to maintain equivalent infection severity and timing. Because virus is entrained upwards, upper parts of the HRT located downstream of the advection flow see more virus than lower parts, and so infection grows, peaks, and resolves later in the lower HRT. Clinically, the infection would appear to progress from the upper towards the lower HRT, as reported in mice, even when the lower HRT infection precedes, and indeed causes, that in the upper HRT. When the spatial MM is expanded to include cellular regeneration and an immune response, it reproduces tissue damage levels reported in patients. It can also captures the kinetics of both seasonal and avian strain infections via parameter changes consistent with reported differences between these strains. This new MM offers a convenient and unique platform from which to study the localization and spread of respiratory viruses (flu, RSV, COVID-19) within the HRT during an infection.

Understanding how the virus spreads within the lung, how efficacious host immune control is, and how each influences acute lung injury and disease severity is critical to combat the infection. Thus, we used an integrative model-experiment exchange to establish the dynamical connections between infection, lung injury, and disease kinetics. Examining these connections during neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) therapy further validated the model and analysis, and suggested that profound effects on lung injury are possible with minimal changes to host-pathogen kinetics. This work provides important biological and mathematical insight and enhances our ability to effectively forecast the disease and antiviral efficacy.

Multiple mathematical modeling approaches have been applied to examine the mechanisms of DIP inter- ference. However, these models focused on either the intra- or the extracellular level of virus replication. In this work, we extend a recently published multiscale model to describe DIP propagation in animal cell cultures infected by IAV. This new model covers fundamental steps during the intracellular replica- tion and the spread of DIPs on the population level. Particularly, the model incorporates the infection conditions, i. e. the multiplicity of infection (MOI), which may change drastically during an infection and represent a crucial factor for IAV replication and DIP interference. To elucidate DIP infection dynamics we conducted a set of cultivations observing the effects of DIPs on wild type virus replication using various IAV and DIP seed virus concentrations. Based on these experimental data, we calibrated our multiscale model to enable the prediction of DIP-induced infection dynamics for a wide range of MOI conditions. Furthermore, we used the model to elucidate options for antiviral therapy, i. e. the DIP to IAV ratio required to inhibit the progression of an influenza infection in animals or humans. In summary, we established a mathematical model that provides a comprehensive description of DIP replication on the intra- and extracellular level to facilitate the development of antiviral therapies, and to describe DIP production in animal cell culture for therapeutic use.

In addition, quantitative mathematical models have been derived that describe dynamics of viral replication at the intracellular and the cell population level. However, to better understand the complex interplay between the virus and its host cell, metabolism during virus replication should be considered in more detail. In this context, MDCK suspension cells were cultivated in shaker flasks and concentrations of external and internal metabolites monitored during cell growth and influenza A virus infection. To characterize the impact of virus infection on host cell metabolism, we have formulated a dynamic mathematical model combining a segregated cell growth model with a structured model of intracellular metabolism in a similar manner as models established for other cell lines. Overall, it considers the dynamics of cell growth, virus production, substrates, metabolic by-products and concentration of key intracellular metabolites from glycolysis, citric acid cycle (TCA), glutaminolysis and pentose phosphate pathway. Model parameters were fitted using mock-infections, and simulations describe well the time courses of the viable cell concentration, mean cell diameter, external substrates, metabolic by-products, and key intracellular metabolites. After virus infection, using the same set of parameters, the model also describes well the dynamics of the viable cell concentration, mean cell diameter changes, substrates, and the virus titer. Only minor differences were found for infected versus mock cultures in the glycolytic pathway. Nev- ertheless, differences between experimental data and model simulations regarding metabolites of TCA and metabolic by-products suggest changes in metabolism, which might be virus-induced. As virus in- fection also affects apoptosis and cell lysis, the interpretation of such differences is not straightforward and experimental findings as well as parameters fitted need to be evaluated in more detail to confirm a virus-related impact on the TCA. Overall, this work will contribute to a better understanding of the complex interplay between cell growth, changes in cell size, virus production and metabolism and support the identification of parameters rele- vant for increasing specific viral productivity of MDCK suspension cells.

From mid-April, COVID-19 cases were declining and there was good evidence to suggest that the effective reproduction number had dropped below 1. A multi-phase relaxation plan to emerge from lockdown was put in place, including primary schools being scheduled to partially reopen in England on 1st June. Regarding the future course of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK, mathematical models have provided, and continue to provide, short and long term forecasts to support evidence-based policymaking. We present a deterministic, age-structured transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 that uses real-time data on confirmed cases requiring hospital care and mortality to provide predictions on epidemic spread in ten regions of the UK. The model captures a range of age-dependent heterogeneities, reduced transmission from asymptomatic infections and produces a good fit to the key epidemic features over time. We illustrate how the model has been used to generate short-term predictions, assess potential lockdown exit strategies, and the impact of children returning to school. We found that significant relaxation of social distancing measures from 7th May could lead to a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 disease and the health system being quickly overwhelmed by a second epidemic wave. On reopening schools, whilst children returning to educational establishments results in more mixing between children and an increase in transmission of the disease, the magnitude of that increase can be low dependent upon the age-groups that return to school and the behaviour of the remaining population. Our work confirmed the effectiveness of stringent non-pharmaceutical measures in March 2020 to suppress the epidemic. It also provided support for the need for a cautious, measured approach to relaxation of lockdown measures, to support the health service through subduing demand on hospital beds. Finally, it indicated that any reopening of schools would result in increased mixing and infection amongst children and the wider population, although the opening of schools alone at that time was unlikely to push the value of R above one.

Some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and R0 are debated.  We collected and analyzed data from China, eight European countries and the US using a variety of inference approaches.  In all countries, the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0. 19-0. 29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2. 4-3. 7 days).  I will discuss the appropriate serial intervals to estimate the basic reproductive number R0 and argue that existing evidence suggests a highly infectious virus with an R0 likely between 4. 0 and 7. 1.  Further, we found that similar levels of intervention efforts are needed, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment. We further show that regular repeated vaccinations will be required to maintain herd immunity if the duration of protective immunity is consistent with other known coronaviruses and that individual-level heterogeneity in protective immunity can significantly affect vaccination policy.

Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the ongoing seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a deterministic transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed pre- vention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to the spread of COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Short-term government policies on social distancing (e. g. community-wide quarantine) that are initiated early can only postpone the epidemic peak whereas later implementation can lead to a reduction of the attack rate and a flatter peak. Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissem- ination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of rapidly spreading awareness on the use of these self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden.

This work uses an individual-based model to predict the impact of two possible strategies for reopening schools to all students (full-time versus part-time rotas) in the UK from September 2020, in combination with different assumptions about the scale-up of testing. Methods: We use Covasim, a stochastic agent-based model for transmission of COVID-19, calibrated to the UK epidemic. The model describes individuals’ contact networks stratified into household, school, workplace and community layers, and uses demographic and epidemiological data from the UK. We simulate six different scenarios, representing the combination of two school reopening strategies and three testing scenarios, and estimate the number of new infections, cases and deaths, as well as the effective reproduction number (R) under different strategies. To account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated different levels of infectiousness of children and young adults under 20 years old compared to older ages. Findings: We found that with increased levels of testing (between 59% and 87% of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active COVID-19 infection, depending on the scenario), and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound may be prevented. Assuming 68% of contacts could be traced, we estimate that 75% of those with symptomatic infection would need to be diagnosed and isolated if schools return full-time in September, or 65% if a part-time rota system were used. If only 40% of contacts could be traced, these figures would increase to 87% and 75%, respectively. However, without such measures, reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a secondary wave that would peak in December 2020 if schools open full-time in September, and in February 2021 if a part-time rota system were adopted. In either case, the secondary wave would result in R rising above 1 and a resulting secondary wave of infections 2-2. 3 times the size of the original COVID-19 wave. When infectiousness of &lt;20 year olds was varied from 100% to 50% of that of older ages, we still find that comprehensive and effective TTI would be required to avoid a secondary COVID-19 wave. Interpretation: To prevent a secondary COVID-19 wave, relaxation of physical distancing including reopening schools in the UK must be accompanied by large-scale testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts, followed by isolation of diagnosed individuals.

In such models the infection history of extant population naturally gives rise to a phylogenetic tree which can be used to study the evolution of the epidemiological process in the past. In this talk we study the problem of computing the probability distribution of such phylogenetic trees arising from partially sampled birth death processes. We consider observations from three distinct sampling schemes. First, individuals can be sampled and removed, through time, and included in the tree. Second, they can be occurrences which are sampled and removed through time and not included in the tree. Third, extant individuals can be sampled and included in the tree. The outcome of the process is thus composed of the reconstructed phylogenetic tree spanning all individuals sampled and included in the tree, and a timeline of occurrence events which are not placed along the tree. We derive a formula for computing the joint probability density of this outcome, which can readily be used to perform maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation of the parameters of the birth-death model. In the context of epidemiology, our probability density enables the estimation of transmission rates through a joint analysis of epidemiological case count data and phylogenetic trees reconstructed from pathogen sequences.

A recent study introduced a mathematical model to support this finding, in which the association of the rate-limiting enzymes into multienzyme complexes in included. However, this model did not fully account for dynamic and random movement of the enzyme clusters, as observed in the experiment.

Describing the dynamics by means of measure-valued processes is at the heart of such approximations.

Typically, the initial 'bump' of activity, that is centered at a particular orientation, slowly softens and dissipates after the stimulus is removed. To explain this phenomenon, we develop a realistic microscopic neural field model, and perform a coarse-graining to obtain a macroscopic neural field equation. The microscopic model contains slow synaptic dynamics, and stochasticity resulting from synaptic transmission failure. At the macroscopic level, after a coarse-graining procedure, this stochasticity results in a neural field equation with an integral convolution (as is standard in neural field equations) but also a spatial Laplacian, and with the diffusion coefficient proportional to the population activity.  Our macroscopic equation can be thought of as a spatially-extended population density equation: it combines the strengths of neural-field equations and population density equations into a single formalism. It allows a deeper understanding of how changes in the average synchronization of neurons affects the macroscopic dynamics. It partly parallels the efforts of Coombes et al in recent years to derive such 'next-generation neural field equations'. We next perform a Large Deviations analysis to study the typical stochastic fluctuations about the limiting equation. This allows us to determine the most likely abnormal behavior that could be induced in the system by finite size effects. This work is based on a preprint (joint with Bart Krekelberg) entitled 'Coarse-Graining of Neural Networks with Stochastic Dynamic Connections.

We explore the effects of noise on the reduced lubrication model proposed in (Fai et al, Active elastohydrodynamics of vesicles in narrow, blind constrictions. Phys. Rev. Fluids, 2 (2017), 113601). The Fokker-Planck approximation fails to capture mean first passage times of velocity switching (tug-of-war effect), and the agent-based model is computationally expensive. For relatively efficient computations, we turn to the master equation and find that it requires an additional calculation to account for non-equilibrium dynamics in the underlying myosin motor population.

The associated fluctuations can be quite large since only a small number of Ca2+ ions enter the cell through a single channel during an action potential, and further increased by the stochasticity in the Ca2+ binding to Ca2+ buffers and sensors. This leads to a widely-held assumption that solving mass-action reaction-diffusion equations for buffered Ca2+ diffusion does not provide sufficient insight into the underlying Ca2+-dependent cell processes. However, several comparative studies showed a surprisingly close agreement between deterministic and trial-averaged stochastic simulations of Ca2+ diffusion, buffering and binding, as long as Ca2+ channel gating is not Ca2+ dependent. We present further comparison of stochastic and mass-action simulations, focusing on Ca2+ dynamics downstream of Ca2+ channel gating and considering spatially-resolved reaction-diffusion modeling in 3D. Namely, we compare the distributions of first-passage-times (FPT) to full binding of the model Ca2+ sensor for vesicle fusion obtained using stochastic and deterministic approaches. We note that in the deterministic formulation, FPT density is equivalent to the time-dependent rate of the final irreversible transition to the fusion-ready sensor state. We show that the discrepancy between deterministic and stochastic approaches in simulating the FPT density can be surprisingly small even when only as few as 40 ions enter the cell per single channel-vesicle complex, despite the fluctuations caused by the Ca2+ binding and unbinding. Further, we demonstrate this close agreement between stochastic and deterministic FPT computation using a highly simplified two-compartment model, whereby the FPT density can be computed exactly using either of the two approaches. The reason for the close agreement between the two methods is that in the absence of Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release, the non-linearities in the exocytosis process involve only bi-molecular reactions. Therefore, the discrepancy between the two approaches is primarily determined by the size of correlations between reactant molecule number fluctuations rather than the fluctuation amplitudes. The small size of reactant correlations is in turn determined by the relationship between the rate of diffusion relative the rate of Ca2+ buffering and binding, as suggested in prior studies. In most common parameter regimes, FPT density is not very sensitive to the fluctuations in the rates of Markovian transitions between distinct sensor states arising from the Ca2+ fluctuations, which in turn leads to small discrepancies between the two approaches.

We and others have leveraged this type of quantitative data to initialize and calibrate biologically-based models of tumor growth and response. Here, we investigate the use of diffusion weighted (DW-) MRI and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-) MRI to non-invasively estimate tumor cellularity and vascularity, respectively, in high grade gliomas at the pre-clinical and clinical levels. At the pre-clinical level, we have developed a 3D, two-species reaction diffusion-based model describing the spatial-temporal evolution of tumor and blood volume fractions [1] during the course of fractionated radiation therapy. Images collected during therapy are used to calibrate tumor-specific growth and response parameters. These calibrated parameters are then used in a forward evaluation of the model to predict response following therapy. We observed less than 12. 3% error in tumor volume predictions. At the voxel-level, we observed 6. 6% and 14. 1% in voxel-wise estimates of tumor and blood volume fraction, respectively. At the clinical level, we have developed a 3D reaction diffusion-based model describing the spatial-temporal evolution of tumor cellularity during and following chemoradiation. Using images collected at pre-treatment and at the 1-month post-chemoradiation visit, we calibrate for patient-specific model parameters. The calibrated parameters are then used to provide individualized predictions of tumor growth and treatment response. In a preliminary study with four patients, we observed less than 11. 1% error in tumor volume predictions and 9. 5% error at the voxel- level. These two studies demonstrate the utility of quantitative imaging data to initialize and calibrate mathematical models of tumor growth and response that can accurately predict both changes in tumor volume and intratumoral heterogeneity.

In contrast to prescribing high dose hypofrac- tionated stereotactic radiosurgery (HFRS, 5x ≥ 6 Gy in daily intervals) with curative intent, we suggest a personalized, palliative treatment strategy aiming for tumour volume management by delivering intermittent high dose treatment every six weeks (iRT, ≥ 6 Gy per fraction). We performed a simulation analysis to compare HFRS, iRT and iRT plus boost (3x ≥ 6 Gy on consecutive days, delivered at time of progression) based on a simple mathematical model of tumour growth, radiation response and patient specific resistance to additional treatments (PD-L1 inhibitor and vascular disruptive agents). Our model uses only two patient specific parameters describing the surviving fraction fol- lowing each HFRS treatment fraction, and the rate of resistance evolution. Tumour growth rate and the efficacy of non-HFSR treatments were estimated for the patient population as a whole. Model parameters were fit from clinical tumour growth response curves of 16 patients of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial NCT02313272 that combined HFSR with beva- cizumab (10 mg/kg, every 2 weeks) and pembrolizumab (100 or 200 mg, every 3 weeks). Tumour volume was assessed by T1-weighted contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imag- ing at four to ten (median six) time points per patient. The obtained parameters were used to estimate the growth response of alternative iRT and iRT+boost treatments for up to 5-10 treatment fractions. Treatment efficacy was scored based on time to regrowth to the last recorded tumour volume per patient. The median coefficient of determination of the model fits was 0. 93(0. 67,0. 99). The model predictions indicated that iRT may delay time to progression only for a subset of eleven patients, whereas iRT+boost treatment was equal or superior to HFSR in 15 out of 16 cases. For up to ten intermittently delivered fractions, iRT+boost was predicted to be marginally significantly better (p = 0. 048) than HFRS. This simulation did not include other aspects of iRT, such as synergistic action with im- munotherapy through repeated antigen sampling, or the flexibility to treat both distal and primary lesions. Despite choosing this worst case estimate, our results suggest that iRT+boost may be a promising treatment alternative for recurrent high grade glioma patients.

A growing literature has been developed demonstrating the clinical relevance of a biomathematical model, the Proliferation- Invasion (PI) model, of glioblastoma growth. Of interest here is the development of a treatment response metric, Days Gained (DG). This metric is based on individual tumor kinetics of cellular diffusion and proliferation estimated through segmented volumes of hyperintense regions on T1-weighted gadolinium enhanced (T1Gd) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs). This metric was shown to be prognostic of time to progression and to be more prognostic of outcome than standard response metrics. While promising, the original paper did not account for uncertainty in the calculation of the DG metric leaving the robustness and the ultimate utility of this response metric in question. Using the Bayesian framework, we consider the impact of two sources of uncertainty: 1) image acquisition and 2) interobserver error in image segmentation. We first utilize synthetic data to characterize what non-error variants are influencing the final uncertainty in the DG metric. We then consider the original patient cohort along with additional cohorts from the recurrent setting to investigate clinical patterns of uncertainty and to determine how robust this metric is for predicting time to progression and overall survival in multiple scenarios. Our results indicate that the key clinical variants are the time between pre-treatment images and the underlying tumor growth kinetics, matching our observations in the clinical cohort. In the original cohort, we demonstrated that for this cohort there was a continuous range of cutoffs between 94 and 105 for which the prediction of the time to progression and was over 80% reliable [3]. While further validation must be done, this work represents a key step in ascertaining the clinical utility of this metric.

However, this is a very complex task due to our limited knowledge of the many biological processes involved and the scarce amount of information available today for patients. A more accessible goal is to use mathematical models to obtain qualitative information allowing to classify patients in classes according to features found to be relevant in the modelling. When those features can be obtained from medical images, we speak of imaging biomarkers. In this talk I will present different types of mathematical models and discuss how each modelling approach leads to the finding of imaging biomarkers that turn out to be true when tested on real patients imaging data. Specifically I will present: MRI-based biomarkers in glioblastoma based on either partial differential equations or discrete mesoscopic simulators [1-3], prognostic PET-based biomarkers based on the peak activity validated for lung and breast cancer [4] and PET-based prognosis biomarkers based on scaling laws for lung cancer, breast cancer, gliomas, and head &amp; neck cancer [5]. These imaging biomarkers are all easy to implement in clinical practice since they do not require model simulations but just measurement of meaningful quantities on the images.

To combat this problem, such models often impose an effective uptake instead. However, it is not immediately clear how to relate properties on the bacterial scale with this effective result. For example, one may intuitively expect the effective uptake to scale with bacterial volume for weak uptake, and with bacterial surface area for strong uptake. I will present a general model for bacterial nutrient uptake, and upscale the system using homogenization theory to determine how the effective uptake depends on the microscale bacterial properties [1, 2]. This will show us when the intuitive volume and surface area scalings are each valid, as well as the correct form of the effective uptake when neither of these scalings is appropriate.

In contrast to lab- oratory settings, natural biofilms commonly comprise multiple strains or species that interact with each other. The nature of such interactions depends on the relative proximity of different strains and thus on the spatial organization of the biofilm. However, little is known about how environmental factors affect this organization. Here, we demonstrate that biofilms of the freshwater bacterium /emphCaulobacter crescentus form distinct patterns of surface colonization depending on local hydrodynamic conditions. By imaging C. crescentus biofilms grown in microfluidic chambers under controlled flow, we observed that surface colonization rate decreases with increasing flow velocity. We also probed the effect of flow intensity on spatial lineage structure using two C. crescentus clones. Surprisingly, segregation increased with flow velocity, in contrary to the assumption that flow induces lineage mixing. To understand how these colonization patterns arise, we developed a theoretical model based on the balance between ad- vection and diffusion: planktonic cells released from the biofilm effectively diffuse as they swim with random trajectories, while they are transported unidirectionally by flow. As flow intensity increases, the residence time of planktonic cells in the channel decreases, reducing their spreading across the channel and decreasing encounters with the surface. To sum up, our work demonstrates that hydrodynamic forces impact biofilm architecture and lineage distribution in multi-strain biofilms. This indicates that social interactions within biofilms are not only dictated by biological factors, but also by mechanical conditions imposed onto the community.

Many of these approaches, however, are only partially successful when tested in infection models. We focus here on an approach that targets the ability of bacteria to bind to host cells – the first stage in infection and of biofilm formation. Through differential equation modelling and com- parison against experimental data, we investigate why the treatment is not fully effective. Furthermore, we use the model to predict how to improve the treatment in a variety of scenarios, including through changes in drug design and/or combination with alternative therapies. We illustrate when the therapy could replace or reduce antibiotic use, ultimately suggesting experimental pathways that should aid in accelerating the development of this novel therapy.

In their natural environments, ranging from human organs to industrial pipelines, biofilms have evolved to grow robustly under signifi- cant fluid shear. Despite intense practical and theoretical interest, it is unclear how strong fluid flow alters aspects of the biofilm life cycle including their formation, growth, and dispersal. In this talk, I will discuss how external flow affects biofilms across multiple scales at each of these stages of their life cycle, through transport of quorum sensing molecules, realignment of growing cells, and biofilm deformation and erosion.

In real-life, however, plants rarely grow in monoculture; hence multi-species scenarios are more realistic. In these cases, additional effects between different species - such as competition and interaction - must be considered. Moreover, plant-soil feedback is recognised as a causal mechanism for plant-species coexistence. Using a mathematical model consisting of four PDEs, we investigate mechanisms of inter- and intra-specific plant-soil feedback on the coexistence of two competing plant species. In particular, the model takes into account both negative and positive feedback influencing the growth of the same and the other plant species. Both the coexistence of the plant species and the dominance of a particular plant species are examined with respect to all model parameters. Analytical and numerical results reveal the emergence of spatio-temporal patterns.

Despite the competition for water, species coexistence of herbaceous and woody species is commonly observed. Thus, tree-grass coexistence in drylands provides an apparent contradiction to the principle of competitive exclusion.  In this talk, I propose that a pattern-inducing spatial self-organisation principle, caused by a positive feedback between local vegetation growth and water redistribution towards dense biomass patches, can also act as a coexistence mechanism for plant species in water-limited ecosystems. To this end, I present a bifurcation analysis of an ecohydrological PDE model for two plant species interacting with a sole limiting resource, based on the Klausmeier reaction-advection-diffusion system for vegetation patterns. Patterned solutions occur as periodic travelling waves and thus theory on limit cycles in dynamical systems can be utilised in the analysis. Firstly, a stability analysis of the system's single-species patterns, performed through a calculation of their essential spectra, provides an insight into the onset of coexistence states. I show that coexistence solution branches bifurcate off single-species solution branches as the single-species states lose their stability to the introduction of a second species. Secondly, I present a comprehensive existence and stability analysis to establish key conditions, including a balance between the species' local competitive abilities and their colonisation abilities, for species coexistence in the model. Finally, I show that the inclusion of intraspecific competition dynamics has a significant impact on the coexistence mechanism that significantly differs from results on classical, nonspatial competition models.

The potential of spatially extended interactions to generate patterns of space distribution in single populations has been extensively explored in the past few decades. In systems of two competing species, nonlocal interactions and the self-organization of populations can have critical dynamical effects but our understanding in these situations is still very limited. In this talk, I will present a kernel-based model for the dynamics of two species competition with nonlocal interactions. Inspired by different biological examples I will show that we can have two distinct scenarios that differ in how intra and interspecific interaction ranges are determined based on each species competition characteristics. In both scenarios we will see that pattern formation offers a coexistence mechanism where the inferior competitor takes advantage of low density locations in the superior competitor spatial distribution.

Classical biome theory suggests that climate is predictive of biome distributions, such that shifts will be continuous and reversible. This view, however, cannot explain the overlap in the climatic ranges of tropical biomes, which some argue may result from fire-vegetation feedbacks, maintaining savanna and forest as bistable states. Under this view, biome shifts are argued to be discontinuous and irreversible. Mean-field bistable models, however, are also limited, as they cannot reproduce the spatial aggregation of biomes. Here we suggest that both models ignore spatial processes, such as dispersal, which may be important when savanna and forest abut. Using a combination of spatial mathematical models and remote sensing data, we examine the contributions of dispersal to determining biome distributions. We find that including dispersal in biome dynamics resolves both the limitations mentioned above of biome models. First, local dispersive spatial interactions, with an underlying precipitation gradient, can reproduce the spatial aggregation of biomes with a stable savanna-forest boundary. Second, the boundary is determined not only by the amount of precipitation but also by the geometrical shape of the precipitation contours. These geometrical effects arise from continental-scale source-sink dynamics, which reproduce the mismatch between biome and climate. Dynamically, the spatial model predicts that dispersal may increase the resilience of tropical biome in response to global change: the boundary continuously tracks climate, recovering following disturbances, unless the remnant biome patches are too small.

In polarized cells, where specific factors are segregated to opposite ends of the cell, asymmetric cell division occurs as a result of positioning the centrosomes along the polarity axis. In many systems, this positioning involves both translocation as well as rotation of the nucleus and its associated centrosomes. Using an individual-based stochastic model of centrosome-associated microtubule dynamics and experiments in early embryos of the nematode worm C. elegans, we explore the role of the motor protein dynein under both wild type and knockdown conditions. We show that dynein activity but not localization is implicated in specific centrosome movement defects in the first cell cycle.

Cell differentiation within tissues is governed by extensive gene expression regulation within cells and communication via chemical signals between cells. Based on their gene expression, cells may divide and change their physical properties, leading to cell- and tissue-level physical forces which can in turn feed back on gene expression between cells. This developmental process may change over time due to Darwinian evolution, but development itself influences the course of evolution by determining the effect that mutations have on the final phenotype. Currently, it is not well-understood how the complex interactions involved in morphogenesis impact the kind of evolutionary changes that can occur.  Here, we investigate the evolution of developmental mechanisms that govern morphogenesis with Embryomaker, an in silico model of 3d epithelium development. We look at short-term evolutionary changes that occur under conservative selection, meaning that the final shape of the tissue is conserved while all else -- gene expression pattern, growth pattern, developmental trajectory -- is allowed to change. We find that substantial change can occur at all levels of organisation, from the structure of the gene regulatory network to gene expression pattern, the duration of the developmental process and the course of morphogenesis. In some cases we observe an increase in the reliability of the developmental process despite not explicitly selecting for it, and show how it is caused by a non-trivial combination of mutations which on their own do not improve -- or even diminish -- fitness. Finally, we show how the coupling of gene expression regulation to morphogenesis influences which mutations are accepted, and thereby the ancestry of genes in the genome.

A recent study used an online crowdsourcing fact-checking approach as one possible intervention to reduce misinformation. However, it remains largely unclear under what conditions crowdsourcing fact-checking efforts can actually deter the spread of misinformation. To address this issue, we model such distributed fact-checking efforts as 'peer policing' that will reduce the perceived payoff to share or disseminate false information (fake news) and also reward the spread of trustworthy information (real news). We use the diffusion approximation method and agent-based simulations to quantify the degree of penalty vs reward needed to make sharing fake news unfavorable in social networks. In the limit of weak selection, we obtain closed-form analytical conditions, which can be expressed as an inequality of these payoff values, with coefficients summarizing the effect of fact-checkers' presence. In reality, fact-checking is subject to human errors. Some fake news occasionally goes unnoticed and endorsed, and some real news is temporally labelled to be fake by fact-checkers. We also quantify the precision threshold required for fact-checkers to ensure fair and transparent policing of wrongdoers while in favor of real news spreaders. Our work has practical guide for developing model-based mitigation strategies for controlling the spread of misinformation that interferes with the political discourse.

Control campaigns have substantial economic consequences; as such there are high demands to reduce costs and reallocate resources. However, if campaigns are stopped prematurely it can result in disease resurgence and subsequently put control efforts back by decades. Early-warning signals offer a computationally inexpensive technique to monitor the progress towards elimination, using statistical indicators calculated on time series data. Early-warning signals are widely used in many fields to anticipate a critical threshold prior to reaching it. A system undergoes the phenomenon known as critical slowing down as it crosses through a threshold. Theory predicts that fluctuations away from the mean will recover more slowly as the system approaches a critical transition (Scheffer et al. , 2009). This is key in infectious disease modelling to assess when the basic reproduction number is reduced below the threshold of one. Recent theoretical advances have shown indicators of critical transitions in epidemiology such as measuring the variance in synthetic disease data. Our work highlights several challenges when applying this theory in practice. One potential problem is known as 'detrending' the data, which can be difficult to achieve in a single time series (Dessavre &amp; Southall et al. , 2019). Accurately detrending the signal removes the mean to obtain the fluctuations, whilst preserving any statistical properties.  We present a novel approach using a metapopulation framework to successfully detrend data using the mean of different geographical subpopulations. A second limitation is that often only incidence-level data is available publicly. However, current theoretical analyses of statistical indicators concentrate on prevalence data, instead of new cases. We demonstrate that indicators calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data (Southall et al. , 2020). Inconsistencies in time series traits between different diseases systems and a variety of disease data types could lead to misleading results when applied to collected data.  In this talk we present methods for dealing with the typical data collected and our results show promising methods for calculating early-warning signals of elimination on real-world noisy data.

Of these models, one of most fundamental is the SIR differential equation model. However, this ubiquitous model has one significant and rarely acknowledged shortcoming: it is unable to account for a disease’s true infectious period distribution.  As the misspecification of such a biological characteristic is known to significantly affect model behavior, there is a need to develop new modeling approaches that capture such information. In this talk, we illustrate an innovative take on compartmental models, derived from their general formulation as systems of nonlinear Volterra integral equations, to capture a broader range of infectious period distributions, yet maintain the desirable formulation as systems of differential equations. Our results include a compartmental model that captures any Erlang distributed duration of infection with only 3 differential equations, instead of the typical inflated model sizes required by differential equation compartmental models, and a compartmental model that captures any mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of an infectious period distribution with 4 differential equations. The significance of our work is that it opens up a new class of easy-to-use compartmental models to predict disease outbreaks that does not require a complete overhaul of existing theory, and thus provides a starting point for multiple research avenues of investigation under the contexts of mathematics, public health, and evolutionary biology.

However, there is a lack of methodologies and user-friendly tools to visualize the complex reaction graphs within these genome-scale metabolic models and simulate their flux behaviors. For this, we have developed a novel methodology and implemented it in a freely-available web application called Fluxer ( https://fluxer. umbc. edu ) that streamlines the simulation and visualization of genome-scale metabolic flux networks with an easy-to-use interface. The application can take as input any metabolic model encoded with the Systems Biology Markup Language format, automatically perform Flux Balance Analysis using linear programming and apply different methods to compute flux graphs. The flux networks can be visualized as spanning trees and complete graphs with different layouts. The interactive graphs can be used to study major pathways contributing to any metabolic reaction or biosynthesis of any metabolite as well as to simulate reaction knockouts. In addition, Fluxer can compute the k-shortest paths between two reaction or metabolites within the model. Nodes can display detailed metabolic and reaction information, including molecular weights, reaction fluxes, and molecular structures. Over 80 whole-genome metabolic reconstructions are readily available for visualization and analysis. The proposed methodology enables efficient analysis and visualization of genome-scale metabolic models towards the discovery of key metabolic pathways.

The presence of nonsmoothness in these models arises from switching phenomena, such as a biochemical threshold signaling sudden insulin release, or a bandwagon effect in rioting behavior corresponding to an outburst of social activity. Nonsmooth modeling frameworks now possess a sensitivity theory that is relevant for nonsmooth ODEs, nonsmooth differential-algebraic equations, optimization-constrained ODEs, and complementarity systems, among others. In this talk, the nonsmooth sensitivity theory is presented, including the generalized derivatives theory upon which it is built. The theory yields an auxiliary, nonsmooth system whose unique solution characterizes (local) sensitivity information. The theory is highlighted using examples from mathematical biology, with numerical implementations that give nonsmooth sensitivity indices. The results can be used to help inform policy decisions (e. g. , in rioting) or for design purposes (e. g. , in the intravenous glucose tolerance test for type 2 diabetes) by uncovering the mechanisms driving the dynamics.

Patch clamp recordings enable us to watch a single ion channel in action by detecting the electrical current flowing through the channel over time. At first glance we only see that the channel opens and closes stochastically but often a closer look reveals that it also alternates between two or more levels of activity – highly active modes where the channel opens and closes frequently, nearly inactive modes in which the channel is mostly closed, as well as intermediate levels of activity. The striking differences in the dynamics the channel exhibits in the different modes suggest that each mode is associated with a distinct three-dimensional configuration (conformation) of the channel protein. Applying statistical change point analysis to a large single channel data set collected from the inositol-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) highlights the importance of this observation: We find that the dynamics of the IP3R is entirely regulated by switching between two modes. In order to build a mathematical model that takes this into account we develop a novel model, the hierarchical Markov model, which enables us to separate modelling the slower dynamics of mode switching from the faster dynamics of opening and closing characteristic of each mode. We will illustrate this approach by fitting a hierarchical Markov model to type 1 and type 2 IP3R data for a wide range of concentrations of IP3R, Ca2+ and ATP. In contrast to most other ion channel models currently available we account for uncertainty by calculating probability distributions for the parameters of our model following a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach.

Lateral diffusion of protein aggregates or clusters on the surface of the PM plays an important role in governing their heterogeneous surface distribution. However, the stability behavior of the surface distribution of protein aggregates remains poorly understood. Therefore, understanding the spatial patterns that can emerge on the PM solely through protein–protein interaction, lateral diffusion, and feedback is an important step toward a complete description of the mechanisms behind protein clustering on the cell surface. In this work, we investigate the pattern formation of a reaction–diffusion model that describes the dynamics of a system of ligand–receptor complexes. The purely diffusive ligand in the cytosol can bind receptors in the PM and the resultant ligand–receptor complexes not only diffuse laterally but can also form clusters resulting in different oligomers. Finally, the largest oligomers recruit ligands from the cytosol using positive feedback. From a methodological viewpoint, we provide theoretical estimates for diffusion-driven instabilities of the protein aggregates based on the Turing mechanism. Our main result is a threshold phenomenon, in which a sufficiently high recruitment of ligands promotes the input of new monomeric components and consequently drives the formation of a single-patch spatially heterogeneous steady state.

We analyse the behaviour of an isolated smooth muscle cell using numerical bifurcation analysis. By modulating model parameters, the result reveals transitions between Type I and II excitabilities in the parameter space. Numerical simulations of our model show that the pattern can bifurcate from been stable to spatiotemporal chaos.

The DSM cells display enhanced spontaneous APs during the overactive bladder state. Estradiol, which is a natural sex hormone, has been suggested to be beneficial in the treatment of overactive bladder.  This study aims in investigating the quantitative analysis of estradiol on membrane excitability of DSM cells. To simulate the estradiol effect, conductances of calcium- and voltage-dependent potassium channels (BK channels) were increased by 40% of its control value in a published DSM model cell. We found that the resting membrane potential (RMP) was more negative (─ 53 mV) than the control (─ 50 mV) value. The peak amplitude of the AP due to estradiol treatment was also significantly decreased. Similar to in the control condition, we have implemented the voltage clamp protocol to investigate the whole cell outward current. Under the effect of the estradiol, the amplitude of outward current was greatly increased due to BK channel.  These findings are consistent with the experiment in guinea pig and rat DSM cells. The future investigation would provide some insight towards the modulating role of voltage-gated Ca2+ current in DSM cells due to estradiol treatment.

Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy (IADT), whereby treatment is cycled on and off, is an attractive therapy option that can reduce cumulative dose and limit toxicities, when compared to continuous therapy. We simulate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) dynamics, with enrichment of PCa stem-like cell (PCaSC) during treatment as a plausible mechanism of resistance evolution. Simulated PCaSC proliferation patterns correlate with longitudinal serum PSA measurements in 70 biochemically recurrent PCa patients. Learning dynamics from each treatment cycle in a leave-one-out study, model simulations predict patient-specific evolution of resistance with an overall accuracy of 89% (sensitivity=73%, specificity=91%). Previous studies have shown a benefit of concurrent therapies with ADT in both low- and high-volume metastatic hormone-sensitive PCa. Model simulations based on response dynamics from the first IADT cycle identify patients who may benefit from concurrent docetaxel, demonstrating the feasibility and potential value of adaptive clinical trials guided by patient-specific mathematical models of intratumoral evolutionary dynamics.

The fraction of surviving cells is a crucial quantity predicting both tumour control and normal tissue toxicity. The gold standard in vitro measurement for cell survival is the colony forming assay (CFA), which is based on the ability of a single cell to grow into a colony. The relationship between surviving fraction (SF) and absorbed dose (D) can be described by a linear-quadratic function: SF=exp(-aD-bD^2), where a and b depend on radiation type other cell properties. However, many cell lines show hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) resulting in a local minimum in the surviving curve below 1 Gy. It is an interesting phenomenon and it may also have clinical implications related to the potential benefits of hyperfractionation. It is generally thought that HRS is a mechanism that protects against carcinogenesis following low dose ionizing radiation. Recently, it has been shown that minimizing the mutation load at the cell population level may result in local minimum in survival-dose relationships if both spontaneous and radiation induced mutations are considered. The model proposed, however, does not account for how cells receive the information required to reduce the mutation load. The aim of the present study was to test whether bystander signalling through the medium provides enough information for the cells to reduce the mutation load of the population with their individual survival or death decision. For this purpose, a mathematical model of bystander signalling was elaborated. Cells are located randomly in a disc shaped dish. Extracellular signals are produced by cells with mutagenic damages. The signal production is proportional to the number of mutagenic damages, while the signal strength decreases by the distance from the signal producing cell. A cell goes into apoptosis if the difference between the number of its mutagenic damages and the number of spontanenous mutations per cell division is high compared to the signal strength at its location. The threshold signal strength for this decision equals to the mean signal strength if all cells have one mutagenic damage. The number of mutagenic damages follows Poisson distribution, and its mean is proportional to absorbed dose. Simulations were performed to reproduce the deviation from the linear quadratic survival curve in case of 45 experimental datasets. During this fitting process, the spontaneous mutation rate and the mutagenic damage induction rate were varied. The model describes most experimental data very well, while the spontanenous mutation rate is close to the reasonable number of 1 mutation per cell division, and the mutagenic damage induction rate is in the order of magnitude of 1 per Gy. These results confirm that low dose hyper-radiosensitivity can be a consequence of bystander signalling aiming to reduce the mutation load of the cell population.

Although these newly diagnosed tumors do not usually pose a threat to the patient, most PCa cases are prescribed a radical treatment immediately after diagnosis (e. g. , surgery or radiotherapy). However, the limited individualization of the clinical management beyond risk-group definition has led to significant overtreatment and undertreatment rates, which might adversely impact the patients' lives and life expectancy, respectively. Thus, PCa is a paradigmatic disease in which an individualized predictive technology could make a crucial difference in clinical practice, thereby separating less aggressive tumors that could be safely monitored from lethal tumors that require immediate treatment. To address this critical need, we propose to use routine clinical and imaging data to construct and parametrize personalized mathematical models of PCa growth including the key mechanisms involved in this pathology. We can then run computer simulations with these models to forecast the growth of a patient's tumor, which may assist physicians in clinical-decision making. Our models have been able to qualitatively reproduce tumor growth over the local anatomy of a patient's prostate extracted from imaging data. We have also been able to capture the dynamics of the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), which is a ubiquitous biomarker in PCa clinical management. We have also studied the inhibitive effect of growth-induced mechanical stress on PCa and how the compression exerted by concomitant benign prostatic hyperplasia dramatically impedes tumor growth. Our ongoing efforts aim at leveraging longitudinal clinically-available quantitative magnetic resonance data to initialize and parameterize our PCa growth models. We believe that our imaging-based models could constitute a promising computational technology to assist physicians to provide a personalized clinical management of PCa.

The movement of this material, delivered via exocytic secretory vesicles, can be categorised under two regimes: 'long distance' movement in the shank (via active transport along actin ﬁlaments), and 'short distance' movement in the apex (where vesicles diffuse and advect freely). Many current models of vesicle transport focus on diffusion in the apical region alone, neglecting advective eﬀects as well as the resulting distribution proﬁle in the pollen tube shank. Using the method of regularised Stokeslets with an adjustment made for axisymmetry, we produce a complete advective velocity proﬁle for cytosolic ﬂow in the tube based on the drag induced by the active transport of vesicles along actin. We use this to calculate exocytic and endocytic vesicle motion in the tube, incorporating vesicle uptake and deposition at the wall, and generating insight into pollen tube growth dynamics.

The HPA axis is dysregulated in chronic stress and psychiatric disorders, but the origin of this dysregulation is unclear and cannot be explained by current HPA models. To address this, we developed a new mathematical model for the HPA axis that incorporates changes in the total functional mass of the HPA hormone-secreting glands. The mass changes are caused by the HPA hormones which act as growth factors for the glands in the axis. We find that the HPA axis shows the property of dynamical compensation, where gland masses adjust over weeks to buffer variation in physiological parameters. These mass changes explain the experimental findings on dysregulation of cortisol and ACTH dynamics in alcoholism, anorexia and postpartum. Dysregulation occurs for a wide range of parameters, and is exacerbated by impaired glucocorticoid receptor (GR) feedback, providing an explanation for the implication of GR in mood disorders. These findings suggest that gland-mass dynamics may play an important role in the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders.

The expansion process can thereby affect the evolutionary path of the growing population, a topic that has gathered much interest recently. The effects of environmental heterogeneity on the evolutionary dynamics of such range expansions remains poorly understood so far - not least due to the large variety of environmental heterogeneity found in nature. We investigate these effects in two different scenarios: neutral evolution of an expanding population and emergence of a new genotype that can spread exclusively in parts of the environment. Specifically, we first consider the effects of isolated obstacles and hotspots as well as bumps in an otherwise flat habitat. The former two are regions which hinder and accelerate the invasion, respectively. We find that those structures have characteristic consequences for neutral genetic diversity. We observe an additional layer of ‘survival of the luckiest’ – complementary to, yet qualitatively different from, founder effects occurring in the presence of 'spatial bottlenecks'. Second, we investigate the establishment of a new genotype that we allow to spread exclusively in some parts of the environment but constrain to have a selective disadvantage elsewhere. We describe the role that environmental structure has in shaping the fate of this new genotype.

PGs emerge in cellular populations, for example in growing bacteria and cancer cells. We study the eco-evolutionary dynamics of a PG in populations that grow in space. In our model, PG-producer cells and free-rider cells can grow according to their own birth and death rates. Co-evolution occurs due to public good-driven surplus in the intrinsic growth rates at a cost to producers. A net growth rate-benefit to free-riders leads to the well-known tragedy of the commons in which producers go extinct. What is often omitted from discussions is the time scale on which this extinction can occur, especially in spatial populations. Here, we derive analytical estimates of the ε-extinction time in differ- ent spatial settings. As we do not consider a stochastic process, the ε-extinction time captures the time needed to approach an extinction state. We identify spatial scenarios in which extinction takes long enough such that the tragedy of the commons never occurs within a meaningful lifetime of the system.

Praised as a reliable genetic marker, the utility of mtDNA derives from its particular molecular properties, including high evolutionary rate, uniparental inheritance, and small size. Such properties make the mtDNA a powerful substrate for inferring geographic structure of populations and phylogenetic relationships. An important application is the use of a standardized segment of the mtDNA for species identification in animals, called the DNA barcode. The high rate of success to distinguish both phylogenetically close and distant species of vertebrates motivates a fundamental question: why does the barcode work and how does it relate to the nuclear DNA (nDNA) divergences during speciation? Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA’s interact during the respiration process, which depends on the coordination of genes from both sources. Recent observations of coevolution between these genomes suggest that this genetic interaction affects organism fitness; thus, mtDNA may play a fundamental role in speciation. Here we study how mito-nuclear interactions affect the speciation process and whether the accuracy of species identification by mtDNA is a consequence of the mito-nuclear coevolution. We investigate the validity of mtDNA-based barcoding in an evolving population, comparing the classification provided by mtDNA with the classification based on nuclear genetic content. Starting from an individual-based model for spatially distributed populations, we simulate the evolution of a population of individuals who carry a recombining nuclear genome and a mitochondrial genome inherited maternally. We compare a null model fitness landscape that lacks any mito-nuclear interaction against a scenario in which interactions influence fitness. Fitness is assigned to individuals according to their mito-nuclear compatibility, which drives the coevolution of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Depending on the model parameters, the population breaks into distinct species and the model output then allows us to analyze the accuracy of mtDNA barcode for species identification depending on the selection strength over the mito-nuclear compatibility. We also register the signatures left in the genetic content and spatial distribution of the populations due to selection imposed on mito-nuclear compatibility. These analyses allow us to evaluate the effects of mito-nuclear interaction on the diversification process and examine to what extent mito-nuclear coevolution assists speciation.

Chemotaxis is important to many of the things cells do in vivo, particularly during development and disease. It is also a favourite topic for mathematical biologists. However, despite decades of studies of how cells can interpret chemotactic gradients, there has been very little attention to how gradients form, and where the information comes from. We have studied a particularly interesting aspect of this problem - self-generated gradients, in which cells form their own gradients at the same time as interpreting them and migrating up them. Self-generated gradients are fascinating, and ideal for mathematical biologists - they are so dynamic that they are nearly impossible to measure, and they incorporate multiple levels of feedback. I will describe how we use modelling, mathematics and experiments on Dictyostelium and cancer cells to understand different self-generated gradients. In particular I will show how cells can solve arbitrarily complex mazes, escape from tumours, and use the information in a gradient to move down-gradient as well as up-gradient.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform. 				If you are submitting an abstract that is not affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please do so in the registration form. If you would like to submit an abstract affiliated with an SMB subgroup, please contact your subgroup chair(s).         	  	  	  &lt;/br&gt;	  	      	    		    						 						  Read the conference announcement						  by Sandy Anderson, SMB President						  Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. . .

Conference Information: 	      				    					The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020.

However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.     	  			&lt;/br&gt;									    	  Conference Schedule: 	        	    * all times are listed in US Eastern Time Zone.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.     	  			&lt;/br&gt;									    	  Conference Schedule: 	        	    * all times are listed in US Eastern Time Zone.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.     	  			&lt;/br&gt;									    	  Conference Schedule: 	        	    * all times are listed in US Eastern Time Zone.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8. 30 am and 5. 00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world.  					We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.     	  			&lt;/br&gt;									    	  Conference Schedule: 	        	    * all times are listed in US Eastern Time Zone.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups. 		   		            While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.     	  			&lt;/br&gt;									    	  Conference Schedule: 	        	    * all times are listed in US Eastern Time Zone.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (Sococo and MathDept. org) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other. 				The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  You must still register for the meeting through the registration website, for a $25 fee. You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting. 				The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology. 				If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.

    "body": "2020/06/08 - Never before in the history of the Society of mathematical biology has the importance of mathematical modelling been more prominent in the public eye. We will probably remember these days, in years to come, as a true opportunity to contribute to the global fight against the pandemic. Predictive mathematical models that capture the underlying mechanistic biology of specific processes are at the heart of everything we do. The COVID-19 virus pandemic has brought into sharp focus the critical importance of mathematical models in both making predictions about current trends in the disease dynamics but also how specific interventions, such as social distancing, might modify them. Understanding these interventions theoretically becomes important not only for mathematical biologists, but also for politicians and other decision makers. Most of the our society members are currently doing some form of social distancing, as is a large proportion of the world. In these confined and difficult times, anxiety and stress are running high. But it is important to remember that we have the power of mathematical modelling behind us. Their predictive ability illustrates why we must slowdown the spread of this virus by staying home. Flattening the curve has become our new mantra. Importantly mathematical modelling will also help us decide how to best end this quarantine. We are at a key point in the history of our society where our models are helping to inform policy decisions that impact millions of lives. Therefore it is fundamental that we make every effort to articulate as clearly as possible what mathematical models are, what they can be used for, and what are their limitations. The integration of mathematics and biology may sound strange at first to the public. But if you find yourself in a situation where you need to explain why certain decisions are being made, please take the time to do so. Articulate the role of predictive mathematical models, but not as something magical, even though they might seem so at times. Rather that they are based on our understanding of the physical and biological processes that underly the spread of this disease. We are a diverse group of scientists and educators who work at the interface of many disciplines not just epidemiology. Our society does have a dedicated subgroup in Mathematical Epidemiology and I encourage you join them if you are interested in this area of research or if you want to learn more. We also have 7 other subgroups covering everything from development to oncology and more - I’m extremely proud of our research diversity. The purpose of this email was to shine a little light and say thank you, to celebrate the wonderful discipline we are part of and highlight the important role mathematical models are playing right now. We are fortunate in many ways, with our ability to more readily work from home than most disciplines. We can make predictions about disease dynamics without ever actually treating a patient or being forced to make difficult decisions in medical care. We can run thousands of realisations of an experiment in a fraction of the time it would take in real life. We can make rigorously constrained predictions about the spread of an epidemic and how to slow it down. Ultimately the countermeasures needed to control and end this pandemic will rely on biomedical research on drugs and vaccines. But again, their impact can and should be studied through the lens of mathematical modelling. I would be remiss if I didn’t give a special thanks to our colleagues, friends and family members in the medical profession. Without their frontline action flattening the curve becomes meaningless. Stay safe, stay home and celebrate mathematical biology! -Sandy Anderson, SMB President "

					<p>The joint Annual Meeting between the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical Biology at Heidelberg has been postponed. However, the Board of Directors of the Society for Mathematical Biology has decided to organize a virtual meeting, eSMB 2020, between  August 17-20, 2020. The meeting will be held between 8.30 am and 5.00 pm US Eastern Time Zone to maximize the participation of people across the world. </p>
					<p>We are inviting all the SMB Subgroup to organize a Mini-symposium, Poster Section and invite a Keynote Speaker. Independent submission for oral or poster presentations will also be accepted. The eSMB 2020 organizing committee will identify the plenary speakers for the annual meeting, and will organize a Mini-symposium and a Poster Session outside the scope of the SMB Subgroups.</p>		      		        
        
        <p>While COVID-19 continues spreading across the world, the Society for Mathematical Biology is keeping the health and safety of our members as our top priority. To reduce or slow the spread of infection, we will hold our 2020 Annual Meeting virtually between August 17-20, 2020. We acknowledge that many are facing challenging personal and/or professional circumstances, but we hope that our Virtual Annual Meeting will allow our community to stay connected, share research, and support each other.</p>

				<p>At the same time, we are excited that the 2020 Annual Meeting will be the inaugural SMB Virtual Meeting. Our communities have long been leaders in sharing research online, and this opportunity is another significant step in that direction.  The Society has selected a third-party virtual meeting platform (<a href="https://www.sococo.com/">Sococo</a> and <a href="https://www.mathdept.org/">MathDept.org</a>) that seamlessly supports live video presentations of sessions, recording of and technical support for those sessions, pre-recorded talks, poster sessions, networking and socializing. The site also will allow small groups of participants to interact in real-time directly with each other.</p>


				<p>The Society for Mathematical Biology is waiving registration fees for our first virtual annual meeting.  <strong>You must still register for the meeting through the <a href="https://smb.wildapricot.org/event-3878590">registration website</a>, for a $25 fee.</strong> You can support the dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences by a small gift of $25 to partially cover the third-party virtual platform cost for your participation. You can make a bigger impact for young mathematical biologists with two other registration options. You can give $50 to support your participation and the participation of a young mathematical biologist at this meeting. Alternatively, you can give $100 to partially support a society travel award to help a student participate at our 2021 Annual Meeting.</p>



				<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously impacting the finances of research and higher education, and academic societies. We need your help, because every young mathematical biologist requires our support and the opportunity to participate in our annual meetings. Thank you for considering joining us in this Virtual Annual Meeting, and your support for mathematical biology.</p>



				<p>If you are interested in attending certain talks, but do not want to participate in the full conference, please indicate so in the registration form. We will ensure that you receive Zoom links for conference talks, but will not register you in the Sococo platform. Since SMB will be paying approximately $25 for each registrant's Sococo access, it is helpful for us to know ahead of time if you do not intend to use the platform.</p>
