	        <p class="mb-3 lead">Modulation of synchronization by a slowly varying M-current</p>
	        <p> The neurotransmitter acetylcholine has been shown to modulate the firing properties of several types of neurons through the down-regulation of voltage dependent potassium currents such as the muscarine-sensitive M-current. In the brain, levels of acetylcholine change with activity. For example, acetylcholine is higher during waking and REM sleep and low during slow wave sleep.  In this talk we show how the M-current affects the bifurcation structure of a generic conductance-based neural model and how this determines synchronization properties of the model. We then use phase-model analysis to study the effect of a slowly varying M-current on synchronization. This is joint work with Victoria Booth, Xueying Wang and Isam Al-Darbasah.

				        <p> 
					        The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic rages on with devasting consequences on human lives and the global economy.  The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this novel coronavirus.  Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5 infected patients hospitalized with severe disease.  Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng/mL.  Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are quite immunogenic.  In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike.  Cyro-electron microscopy structures of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two RBDs revealed recognition of the closed, “all RBD-down” conformation of the spike.   Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.

				        <p> 
					        Throughout the lifespan of an organism, tissues are remodeled to shape organs and organisms and to maintain tissue integrity and homeostasis. Apical constriction is a ubiquitous cell shape change of epithelial tissues that promotes epithelia folding and cell/tissue invagination in a variety of contexts.  Apical constriction promotes tissue bending by changing the shape of constituent cells from a columnar-shape to a wedge-shape.  Drosophila gastrulation is one of the classic examples of apical constriction, where cells constrict to fold the primitive epithelial sheet and internalize cells that will give rise to internal organs. We have used a combination of imaging, experimental perturbation, and modeling, to determine how actomyosin organization promotes tissue folding.  The actin cytoskeleton is organized in both time and space to facilitate apical constriction.  We found that actomyosin contraction is pulsatile and requires dynamic regulation of upstream signaling processes. In addition, we found that actomyosin becomes organized into oriented fibers, which generates anisotropic tension that is critical for tissue shape.  Furthermore, connectivity within the network of actomyosin fibers is highly redundant, promoting the robustness of folding.

				        <p> 
					        Most people think they have pretty good bullshit detectors, at least when it comes to advertising hyperbole, weasel words, and politicians’ promises. Quantitative claims are harder: Numbers have the sense of objectivity and precision, and people feel less confident in challenging them. Yet with COVID-19, quantitative epidemiology is on the front page of every newspaper on every day of the week. Shortly before the pandemic broke out, I finished a book on how to spot and refute quantitative misinformation. Every lesson in the book has proven useful during the current pandemic. In this talk, I will present a tour of how misleading numbers, statistics, mathematics, and data graphics have muddied the social and traditional media streams that we all rely upon during COVID. I will give examples of deliberate disinformation, and examples of unintended misinformation around the pandemic. And I will explore how as citizens and as educators we all can promote data reasoning and quantitative literacy.
